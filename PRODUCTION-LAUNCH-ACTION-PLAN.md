## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong?

1. **Image sourcing delays**
   - **Risk:** Client doesn't have professional floor plan images
   - **Mitigation:** Have backup plan to create placeholder images or hire photographer
   - **Timeline impact:** Could delay by 1-2 weeks

2. **Missing address for Columbine**
   - **Risk:** Client doesn't respond with address
   - **Mitigation:** Look up address on Google Maps or public records
   - **Timeline impact:** Could delay Day 2 launch

3. **Technical deployment issues**
   - **Risk:** Production environment issues
   - **Mitigation:** Test on staging first, have rollback plan

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise after launch:
