Welcome to Golden Pond

Golden Pond has been part of the Golden community for more than 20 years. We provide Independent Living, Assisted Living, and Memory Care in one location — so residents can remain in the same community as their needs change.

Because we’re locally owned, families find a different level of connection here. Leadership is approachable, staff tend to stay long-term, and decisions are made with the people of Golden in mind.

Dining Without Worry
Enjoy freshly prepared meals every day — no shopping, cooking, or cleanup. Menus are designed to be nutritious and comforting, and meals are served restaurant-style so residents can eat together and build connections. Families are welcome to join in our private dining room.

Life Enrichment That Fits
Our activity calendar is full but flexible. Residents can join fitness classes, art workshops, book clubs, and social gatherings, or simply enjoy quiet time in the library or garden. Outings into Golden — from local restaurants to cultural events — help residents stay part of the community.

Licensed nurses and trained caregivers are on-site 24/7. We create personalized care plans that adjust as needs change, from daily medication reminders to full memory care support. Families are kept in the loop with open communication and approachable leadership.
