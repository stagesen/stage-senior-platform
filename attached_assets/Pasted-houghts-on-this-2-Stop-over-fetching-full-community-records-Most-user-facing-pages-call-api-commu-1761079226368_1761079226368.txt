houghts on this? 2. Stop over-fetching full community records
Most user-facing pages call /api/communities, even when they only need a community name for a dropdown or CTA, and the landing page pulls the entire 
community list before filtering client-side. The API returns every amenity and care-type payload for each community, so these duplicate requests send far
 more data than needed.
Fix: Introduce lightweight endpoints (e.g., /api/communities/summary) or add select= query options that let the client request only IDs/names, and update
 the pages to use the slimmer responses. 

● This is a very good optimization and a common pattern in production APIs. Here are my thoughts:

  Why this matters:

  1. Network payload reduction - If a dropdown only needs { id, name } but you're sending full community objects with all amenities, care types, images,
  etc., you could be sending 10-50x more data than necessary
  2. Faster page loads - Smaller payloads = faster transfers, especially on mobile/slow connections
  3. Reduced server load - Less database joining and serialization work
  4. Better caching - Smaller, focused responses cache better and are more likely to be reused

  Implementation approach - I'd recommend both:

  1. Query parameter approach (more flexible):

  // /api/communities?select=id,name,slug
  // /api/communities?select=id,name,slug,city,state
  Pros:
  - Single endpoint, flexible
  - Easy to add new field combinations without new routes
  - Common pattern (Supabase, PostgREST use this)

  Cons:
  - More complex implementation
  - Need to validate requested fields
  - Might allow overfetching if not controlled

  2. Dedicated endpoints (more explicit):

  // /api/communities/summary → { id, name, slug }
  // /api/communities/dropdown → { id, name }
  // /api/communities/landing → minimal data for landing page
  Pros:
  - Clear, semantic endpoints
  - Easier to optimize each use case
  - Type-safe (each endpoint has defined response shape)

  Cons:
  - More routes to maintain
  - Less flexible

  My recommendation:

  Start with dedicated endpoints for the most common use cases you identified:
  - /api/communities/summary - id, name, slug, city, state (for listings/dropdowns)
  - /api/communities/names - just id + name (for simple selects)

  Then optionally add a select parameter to the main endpoint for power users/admin interfaces.

  Quick wins to implement first:

  1. Landing page filtering - Move the filtering server-side immediately. No reason to send all communities to filter client-side.
  2. Dropdown/CTA endpoints - These are probably the most repeated calls
  3. Audit with DevTools - Check Network tab to see which pages are the worst offenders

  Would you like me to implement this optimization? I can:
  1. Create the new lightweight endpoints
  2. Update the client-side code to use them
  3. Add the select query parameter support if you want that flexibilit
