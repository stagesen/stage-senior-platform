Fall Prevention: Creating a Safer Environment for Aging Adults (2025)

Falls are common, costly, and—importantly—largely preventable. With a few targeted changes at home (and the right programs in senior living), older adults can stay active and independent longer.

Why fall prevention matters (updated stats)

1 in 4 older adults reports a fall each year—over 14 million Americans 65+. 
CDC
+1

Emergency departments recorded nearly 3 million visits for older adult falls in 2021. 
CDC

In 2023, the U.S. recorded 41,400 deaths from unintentional falls among adults 65+ (69.9 per 100,000). In Colorado, there were 936 deaths (99.3 per 100,000), higher than the national rate. 
CDC

Takeaway: Falling once doubles the chance of falling again—but proactive steps reduce risk. 
CDC

Simple home modifications that work

Remove tripping hazards

Clear clutter and loose cords from walkways.

Secure or remove throw rugs (non‑slip backing or double‑sided tape).

Keep essentials within easy reach to avoid step stools.
These come straight from CDC’s home safety checklist.

Improve lighting

Add nightlights from bed → bathroom → kitchen; ensure stairways are well‑lit with switches at both ends; consider motion‑sensor lights for hallways. 
CDC

Add safety features

Grab bars beside toilets and inside/outside showers; non‑slip mats in tubs; handrails on both sides of stairs; contrasting strip on stair edges. 
CDC

Evidence check: Structured home hazard modifications reduce falls—especially for higher‑risk adults.

Health factors that raise fall risk (and what to do)

Vision & hearing

Get annual eye exams; treat cataracts when recommended; add task lighting to reduce glare. 
National Institute on Aging

Medications

Many fall‑risk‑increasing drugs (FRIDs)—for sleep, anxiety/depression, blood pressure, and pain—can cause dizziness or drowsiness. Ask for a medication review and deprescribing when appropriate. (World falls guidelines: strong recommendation to assess FRIDs.) 
PMC

Balance, strength & mobility

Exercise is the single most effective intervention. The USPSTF (2024) recommends exercise for older adults at increased risk; multifactorial programs offer a small net benefit. 
USPSTF

Cochrane and meta‑analyses show programs emphasizing balance + functional training + resistance reduce falls; Tai Chi is specifically supported.

Vitamin D? Don’t rely on it for fall prevention. The USPSTF’s 2024 draft update recommends against vitamin D (with or without calcium) for preventing falls in community‑dwelling older adults. (Maintain adequate intake if clinically indicated, but not for fall prevention.) 
USPSTF

Stay active (safe ideas to start)

Chair‑supported balance drills (narrow → tandem → single‑leg stance).

Sit‑to‑stands, heel raises, side‑steps.

Tai Chi 2–3x/week (evidence‑based classes are widely available).

Tip: Ask your PCP about a falls screen and a referral to physical therapy (e.g., Otago, SAIL) if you feel unsteady. 
USPSTF

Footwear & clothing: small changes, big difference

Do wear: supportive shoes with non‑slip outsoles, secure fastening (laces/straps), low heel, roomy toe box, and a firm heel counter. Avoid loose, backless slippers and overly thick, squishy soles that dull ground feel. Evidence and CDC STEADI materials back these features.

Clothing: hem pants/robes to avoid dragging; consider hip protectors if advised after a fracture.

Technology that helps

Wearable call buttons or watches with fall detection.

Induction cooktops/auto‑shutoff stoves; smart nightlights; medication dispensers with alarms.

Keep a phone reachable from the floor and post large‑print emergency contacts near phones. (CDC home safety checklists endorse these practical steps.)

How senior living communities prevent falls

Built‑in safety

Non‑slip flooring, handrails, good lighting and contrast, emergency call systems in residences and bathrooms, 24/7 on‑site staff, and routine wellness checks. Many campuses coordinate medication management and bring PT/OT on site or on call. These are core elements of well‑run communities like Stage Senior’s, which emphasize resident‑focused care and on‑site supports.

Proactive programs

Evidence‑based exercise classes, fall‑risk screening at move‑in and periodically, care plan updates when mobility changes, and rapid post‑fall reviews to prevent recurrences.

What to ask on a tour

What environmental features (non‑slip floors, rails both sides, stair contrast) are standard?

Where are call buttons, and what’s the average response time?

How do you assess fall risk and update care plans?

Is medication management available (e.g., blister packs, dispensers)?

Are there balance/fall‑prevention classes and on‑site PT/OT?

How are post‑fall root‑cause analyses handled and family updates shared?

A step‑by‑step action plan (you can start this week)

Do a home audit (nightlights, remove rugs/cords, add grab bars, two‑sided handrails). 
CDC

Book appointments: primary care/geriatrician, medication review, vision check. 
PMC

Start exercise: 2–3 sessions/week focused on balance + strength; look for Tai Chi class options. 
USPSTF

Upgrade footwear: supportive, non‑slip, secure fastening; ditch backless slippers. 
CDC

Add tech: call system/watch, medication dispenser, motion lighting. 
CDC

Log any falls/near‑falls and share with your clinician.

If risk remains high—or caregiving is stretched—tour assisted living or memory care and ask the safety questions above.

I built a printable Fall Prevention Toolkit — 2025 (Colorado) with a room‑by‑room safety audit, a non‑prescriptive balance/strength quick‑start, a medication review worksheet, a fall/near‑fall log, and a community safety evaluation you can use on tours.
