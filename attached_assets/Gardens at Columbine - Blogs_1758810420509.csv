Today was an absolute blast as we hosted the delightful team from <a href=""http://milehighmusicaltails.com/""><strong>Mile High Musical Tails</strong></a>. If you're unfamiliar, this is a club dedicated to fostering closer bonds between people and their dogs through a fun and unique activity ‚Äì canine freestyle dancing.</p><p id="""">We were honored to have the presence of the club's founder and president, Sue Cianfarani, a former social worker turned passionate dog trainer. Sue discovered dog dancing back in 1999 and has since dedicated her life to this wonderful activity, establishing Mile High Musical Tails in 2002. Her team started with just five dog owners but has grown exponentially, dancing their way into the hearts of many.</p><p id="""">Our residents, staff, and visitors had the pleasure of witnessing the beautiful synergy between the dancing dogs and their owners. It was not just entertaining but also incredibly heartwarming to see the deep bond and communication between them as they moved gracefully to the music. The dogs were not just following commands, but genuinely enjoying the rhythm, music, and companionship. It was, without a doubt, an eye-opening demonstration of the wonderful relationship one can have with their furry friends.</p><p id="""">In addition to the amazing performances, Sue and her team took the time to share their journey and the benefits of canine freestyle dancing. The most notable takeaway was how this activity promotes responsible pet ownership and establishes a profound connection between dogs and their owners (we are apet friendly facility so if you or your loved one are nervous about leaving a best friend behind you can bring them with you at this facility). It goes to show how communication with our pets can go beyond the traditional bounds and turn into something extraordinarily beautiful.</p><p id="""">I can safely say that our day with Mile High Musical Tails left us all with smiles on our faces and a newfound appreciation for the relationship we can cultivate with our pets. It was a day filled with joy, music, wagging tails, and of course, some impressive dance moves!</p><p id="""">For those who couldn't join us today, I encourage you to check out Mile High Musical Tails' website and learn more about this wonderful club. And who knows? Maybe we will have them back for an encore performance!</p><p id="""">Until next time, keep dancing, keep loving, and keep cherishing those special bonds.</p><p id="""">Christa</p><p id="""">‚Äç</p>","Experience the fun and joy our residents shared with Mile High Musical Tails, an innovative club that intertwines the love of dogs and dance.",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6419daa2eec9a95f450b95a6/647a4a49575645bab03cc276_cover.webp,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6419daa2eec9a95f450b95a6/647a4a4b523307663b488195_thumb.webp,false,Activities¬†,sydney-hertz,general,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6419daa2eec9a95f450b95a6/647a4a4f7790570607a7b0ce_1.webp,,,Fri Apr 07 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
