# Top-of-Funnel Content & Paid Media Campaign Plan

## 1. Audience & Buyer Journey Insight
- **Primary personas:**
  - *Adult children decision-makers* researching senior living options for parents; skew female, aged 45-64, college-educated, digitally savvy, emotionally overwhelmed.
  - *Prospective residents* (active seniors 65+) evaluating lifestyle fit, affordability, and services.
  - *Healthcare referrers* (social workers, discharge planners) seeking trusted partners to recommend post-acute transitions.
- **Pain points & triggers:** confusion about levels of care, cost transparency, differentiating communities, urgency after medical events, fear of losing independence.
- **Top-of-funnel goals:** build trust, educate on care journeys, capture intent signals (email, resource downloads, webinar sign-ups).
- **Messaging map:**
  | Persona | Key Questions | Emotional Drivers | Proof Points to Feature | CTA Angle |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Adult children | "How do I know which care level is right?" "What will this cost?" | Relief from guilt, desire for safety, time back | Care navigator quiz insights, testimonials from other families, transparent pricing ranges | "Find your family's care roadmap" |
  | Prospective residents | "Will I fit in?" "What is daily life like?" | Community, independence, purposeful aging | Lifestyle microsite, activity calendars, resident-led videos | "Explore a day in the community" |
  | Healthcare referrers | "Can I trust this partner with outcomes?" | Clinical excellence, reliable communication | Safety Benchmark data, care coordination workflows, case studies | "Access referral toolkit" |
- **Journey alignment:** map each persona's awareness stage touchpoints (organic search, physician referral, social discovery), define nurture sequences that move them to consideration (retargeting, email education, webinar invites).
