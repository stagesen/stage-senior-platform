1) Conversion schema (shared across Google & Meta)

Web events (fire when these happen on your pages):

GenerateLead (contact form submit)

ScheduleTour (tour form submit or Calendly confirm)

PhoneCallStart (click‑to‑call) & Website Call (DNI call starts)

PricingRequest (pricing form completion)

RSVPEvent (open house RSVP)

ChatStart (if you use web chat)

Event parameters (send with every event):
event_id (UUID), value (USD), currency, care_level (AL/MC/IL), metro (e.g., “Littleton”), community_name (when applicable), landing_page, gclid, wbraid/gbraid (iOS), fbc, fbp, consent flags.

Primary conversions in Google Ads: ScheduleTour, Website Call (>=60s), RSVPEvent.

Secondary conversions: GenerateLead, PricingRequest, ChatStart (observe only unless later promoted to Primary). 
Google Help
+1

Values (for value‑based bidding and ROAS modeling—start with proxies, refine with real outcomes):

GenerateLead = $25

ScheduleTour = $250

Deposit = $1,000 (offline/ECL)

Move‑In = $6,000 (offline/ECL)

Rationale: VBB lets Smart Bidding find higher‑value prospects instead of just more leads. 
Google Help
+1

2) Google Ads: conversions & integrations (step‑by‑step)
A) Link accounts & define conversions

Link GA4 ↔ Google Ads (for reporting & audiences). 
Google Help

In Google Ads → Tools & Settings → Conversions, create actions for:

Schedule Tour (Web), Pricing Request (Web), Lead (Web).

Website call conversions (DNI/forwarding number)—set 60‑second threshold. 
Google Help
+1

Import (offline): “from clicks” for Deposit and Move‑In (using Data Manager or API). 
Google Help

Mark only the actions you want to bid on as Primary; the rest stay Secondary for observation. 
Google Help

B) Install tags & Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL)

Use GTM (web) to fire the Google tag & conversion events.

Enable Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL) and map hashed email/phone from the form. (Google provides GTM & gtag instructions.) 
Google Help
+1

Consent Mode v2: set ad_user_data and ad_personalization signals based on the user’s choices—required for certain EMEA use cases and recommended overall. 
Google Help
+1

C) Capture click IDs & phone calls

Auto‑tagging ON; capture gclid/wbraid/gbraid into hidden form fields and your CRM. Later, import conversions by matching click IDs + timestamps. 
Google Help

Website call tracking: implement Google Forwarding Numbers (DNI) on call‑visible pages; set call‑length thresholds. 
Google Help

Optional: import phone call conversions from your call platform if not using Google forwarding numbers. 
Google Help
+1

D) Offline & Enhanced conversions (beyond the browser)

Classic offline: import CSV/API with gclid/wbraid/gbraid, conversion name, value, and time. 
Google Help
+1

ECL: upload hashed first‑party identifiers (email/phone) tied to the original lead for Deposit and Move‑In; recommended vs. legacy offline import. Use Google Ads Data Manager (supports Salesforce, HubSpot, Sheets, SFTP, HTTPS, etc.). 
Google Help
+1

Compliance note (housing): Google limits audience personalization for housing ads in the US/CA (no age, gender, ZIP, etc.). Keep all demographics enabled and avoid ZIP targeting. 
Google Help

3) Meta: conversions & integrations (step‑by‑step)
A) Foundation

Verify your domain in Business Settings → Brand Safety → Domains. 
Facebook

Install Meta Pixel via GTM and create standard events (Lead, CompleteRegistration for ScheduleTour), including value and currency. Use Test Events to validate. 
Facebook
+1

B) Add Conversions API (CAPI) in parallel

Send the same events from server with the same event_id as the browser event to deduplicate; Meta’s best practice is event_name + event_id matching. 
Facebook Developers
+1

Include _fbc/_fbp and customer information parameters (hashed email/phone) to improve Event Match Quality. 
Facebook Developers
+1

C) Offline outcome tracking (deposits & move‑ins)

Create a Dataset in Events Manager (Meta replaced “Offline Event Sets” creation with Datasets). Upload or stream real‑world events (phone closes, move‑ins) with timestamps + PII (hashed) + value. 
Facebook
+1

Compliance note (housing): On Meta you must choose the Special Ad Category: Housing, which restricts age/zip targeting, etc. Plan to rely on creative, geography radius, and first‑party audiences. 
Facebook
+1

4) Data layer & form requirements (copy/paste to your spec)

On form submit (all lead forms):

dataLayer.push({
  event: 'ScheduleTour',             // or 'GenerateLead', 'PricingRequest'
  event_id: crypto.randomUUID(),     // generate once, reuse for Meta CAPI dedup
  value: 250, currency: 'USD',
  care_level: 'Assisted Living', metro: 'Littleton',
  community_name: '—', 
  gclid: getParam('gclid') || readCookie('_gclid'),
  wbraid: getParam('wbraid'), gbraid: getParam('gbraid'),
  fbc: readCookie('_fbc'), fbp: readCookie('_fbp'),
  user: { email: hash(email), phone: hash(phone) },
  consent: { ad_user_data: true, ad_personalization: true }
});


Ensure hidden fields persist gclid/gbraid/wbraid and fbc/fbp into the CRM record. 
Google Help
+1

GTM sends to Google Ads (ECL) and Meta (Pixel + CAPI) using the same event_id. 
Google Help
+1

5) CRM & file import templates

Google Ads – offline click conversions (CSV columns):

Google Click ID, Conversion Name, Conversion Time, Conversion Value, Conversion Currency
E.g.,  Cj0KCQ... , Move-In, 2025-10-20 14:35:00, 6000, USD


(Upload via Google Ads → Conversions → Uploads or automate via Data Manager/API.) 
Google Help

Meta – offline (Dataset) CSV essentials:
event_name (e.g., Purchase or custom “MoveIn”), event_time (epoch), value, currency, hashed email/phone, fbc/fbp when available, and an event_id if you want deduping with web events. (Create/assign Datasets in Events Manager first.) 
Facebook Developers

6) Campaign management blueprint
Google Ads (search‑led, VBB‑ready)

Account structure

Search – Nonbrand: Care level × City clusters (e.g., Assisted Living – Littleton area), Exact + Broad with negatives, Maximize Conv. Value (or tCPA if values aren’t ready). 
Google Help

Search – Brand/Competitor (brand defense; competitor careful on policy).

Performance Max (Lead Gen) for scale (brand exclusions, strict asset discipline). 
Google Help
+1

Demand Gen (former Discovery) for mid‑funnel education (family caregivers in research mode). 
Google Help

Assets: RSAs aligned to care level + geo; sitelinks (Amenities, Floor Plans, Pricing, Schedule a Tour), call assets, and location assets (as applicable).

Bidding: Start Maximize Conversions (with CPA cap) → move to Maximize Conversion Value once proxy values are live and stable. 
Google Help

Policies (housing): no age/gender/ZIP constraints; use city/radius and contextual keywords. 
Google Help

Meta (Special Ad Category: Housing)

Objectives: Leads (conversion location: website) or Sales (if you’re using value events).

Structure:

Prospecting (broad within allowed geo radius; Advantage+ placements).

Engaged website visitors and first‑party lists for retargeting (within policy).

Creative: Short social video + carousels featuring local ownership, chaplain/counselor support, gardens & fresh food, resident life—aligns to your brand differentiators.

Measurement: Watch Event Match Quality and Test Events; fix low EMQ by passing hashed email/phone and fbc/fbp. 
Facebook
+1

7) QA & monitoring checklist (weekly)

Google Tag Assistant / real‑time conversion debug; Conversions → Diagnostics for import health. 
Google for Developers

Meta Events Manager → Test Events (verify Pixel + CAPI dedup via event_id) and monitor EMQ scores. 
Facebook
+1

Call conversions: confirm forwarding numbers render and call duration threshold logs conversions. 
Google Help

Consent Mode v2: confirm consent states propagate; ads still model conversions when consent is denied. 
Google Help

8) Naming conventions & UTM plan

Campaign name: GOOG_Search_AL_Littleton_[B/Broad]_[US-CO]
Ad group: AL_Littleton_Core / AL_Littleton_Competitors
Meta Ad set: Housing_AL_Littleton_Prospecting_[Radius]

UTM template (both platforms):
utm_source={google|meta}&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&utm_content={{ad.id}}&utm_term={keyword}

Store alongside: gclid / gbraid / wbraid / fbc / fbp / event_id.

9) 90‑day rollout

Special Ad Category: Housing rules. 
Facebook

11) What we’ll hand to dev (condensed spec)

GTM (web) tags:

Google tag, conversion events (GenerateLead, ScheduleTour, etc.) with ECL mapping (hashed email/phone). 
Google Help

Meta Pixel events mirroring those names; event_id generated client‑side and pushed to the dataLayer; store fbc/fbp & click IDs. 
Facebook Developers

GTM (server) or backend webhook:

Send Meta CAPI events with the same event_id (dedup). 
Facebook Developers

Optionally send Google ECL via API/Data Manager for late‑stage outcomes. 
Google for Developers
+1

CRM fields to add: email (raw for hashing server‑side), phone, event_id, gclid, wbraid, gbraid, fbc, fbp, consent flags, care_level, community_name, conversion stage, values.

Privacy note: never send health/diagnosis or sensitive data to ad platforms; ECL/CAPI uses hashed identifiers and must respect user consent preferences. 
Google Help

12) Campaign guardrails specific to Stage Senior

Creative leans into local ownership, chaplain/counselor support, fresh‑food culture, and family trust—this is your unfair advantage in ads and landing pages, and it materially lifts conversion rates.

Meta & Google housing rules constrain targeting; compensate with geography, creative relevance, and first‑party lists (site visitors, engaged emails) rather than demographic filters.

# 1) GTM Implementation Spec (Markdown)
gtm_spec = """# Stage Senior — Ads & Measurement Implementation Spec (GTM + ECL + CAPI)

> This document defines the *copy‑paste* implementation details to wire **Google Ads** (incl. Enhanced Conversions for Leads & offline imports) and **Meta** (Pixel + CAPI + Offline/Datasets), with **Consent Mode v2** and a unified **dataLayer**. It complements your landing page system and page inventory.

---

## 0) Prereqs (accounts & foundations)

- **Google Ads**: access to Conversions, Data Manager, and call reporting enabled.
- **GA4**: property linked to Google Ads (Admin → *Google Ads links*). 
- **GTM Web**: container installed site‑wide (head & body snippets). Optional **GTM Server** for CAPI.
- **Meta Business Manager**: Pixel ID, verified domain, Events Manager access; Conversions API destination (server/app).
- **Call tracking**: Google forwarding numbers (website calls) or 3rd‑party DNI with import.
- **CMP/Consent banner** implementing **Consent Mode v2** signals.

---

## 1) Consent Mode v2 (site‑wide, before any tags)

> Default to **denied** until the user provides consent. Your CMP should update these signals when the user accepts/changes preferences.

```html
<script>
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}

// Default (user has not made a choice yet)
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'ad_storage': 'denied',
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_user_data': 'denied',
  'ad_personalization': 'denied'
});

// Example: on user Accept in your CMP callback
// gtag('consent', 'update', {
//   'ad_storage': 'granted',
//   'analytics_storage': 'granted',
//   'ad_user_data': 'granted',
//   'ad_personalization': 'granted'
// });
</script>


Do this in a Consent Initialization tag in GTM so it runs before all other tags.

Why: ad_user_data is required for measurement use cases like Enhanced Conversions; ad_personalization controls remarketing and similar uses.

2) Unified dataLayer events (copy‑paste schema)

Fire one of these Custom Events in JS when a form successfully submits or a scheduler/tour is confirmed.

Always show details
// Helper: generate a UUID for event_id if your app doesn't provide one
function ss_uuid(){return ([1e7]+-1e3+-4e3+-8e3+-1e11).replace(/[018]/g, c =>
  (c ^ crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0] & 15 >> c / 4).toString(16)
)};

// Example payload for a tour booking
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
window.dataLayer.push({
  event: 'ScheduleTour',                     // or GenerateLead, PricingRequest, RSVPEvent, PhoneCallStart, ChatStart
  event_id: ss_uuid(),
  value: 250,                                // proxy; override with true values if known
  currency: 'USD',
  care_level: 'Assisted Living',             // Assisted Living | Memory Care | Independent Living
  metro: 'Littleton',
  community_name: 'The Gardens at Columbine',// optional
  landing_page: window.location.href,

  // click IDs & meta IDs captured client‑side
  gclid: new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('gclid'),
  gbraid: new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('gbraid'),
  wbraid: new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('wbraid'),
  fbc: (document.cookie.match(/_fbc=([^;]+)/)||[])[1],
  fbp: (document.cookie.match(/_fbp=([^;]+)/)||[])[1],

  // map hashed identifiers for Enhanced Conversions for Leads & Meta EMQ
  user: {
    // Replace with your form fields when available
    email_sha256: sha256(window.ssForm?.email || ''),
    phone_sha256: sha256(window.ssForm?.phone || '')
  },

  consent: { ad_user_data: true, ad_personalization: true } // set from CMP
});

// Minimal SHA‑256 helper (for illustration; use a robust hasher in production)
async function sha256(input){
  const enc = new TextEncoder().encode((input||'').trim().toLowerCase());
  const buf = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', enc);
  return Array.from(new Uint8Array(buf)).map(b=>b.toString(16).padStart(2,'0')).join('');
}


Custom events to implement: GenerateLead (contact form), ScheduleTour (tour/scheduler confirm), PricingRequest (multi‑step quote), PhoneCallStart (click‑to‑call), RSVPEvent, ChatStart.

3) GTM Web — Tags, Triggers, Variables
3.1 Tags (create once per conversion action)

Google Ads – Conversion (Web)

Tag type: Google Ads Conversion Tracking

Conversion ID/Label: from Google Ads → Conversions.

Trigger: Custom Event equals the matching dataLayer event (e.g., ScheduleTour).

Enhanced Conversions for Leads: In tag settings → Turn on Enhanced Conversions → Manual mapping:

Email: {{DLV - user.email_sha256}} (set as SHA‑256 hashed)

Phone: {{DLV - user.phone_sha256}} (SHA‑256)

Send dynamic values: value and currency from dataLayer.

GA4 – Event (optional but recommended)

Tag type: GA4 Event

Event name mirrors your dataLayer event.

Params: value, currency, care_level, metro, community_name.

Meta Pixel – Web events

Tag type: Custom HTML or Community Template

Fire Lead for GenerateLead, and CompleteRegistration for ScheduleTour.

Include {eventID: {{DLV - event_id}}} in the fbq('track', ...) call and pass value, currency, and custom params.

Trigger: matching Custom Event.

Website Call Conversion (Google)

Create a Website calls conversion in Google Ads (with Google forwarding numbers).

Implement the event snippet (or a GTM Custom HTML tag) on pages where the phone number is displayed.

Optional: bind click‑to‑call links to fire a PhoneCallStart event for analytics alignment.

3.2 Triggers

Type: Custom Event

Event name: GenerateLead, ScheduleTour, PricingRequest, RSVPEvent, PhoneCallStart, ChatStart.

3.3 Variables

DLV: Data Layer Variables for event_id, value, currency, care_level, metro, community_name, user.email_sha256, user.phone_sha256, gclid, gbraid, wbraid, fbc, fbp.

URL vars for gclid/gbraid/wbraid (if you prefer GTM URL Variable).

1st‑party cookie variables for _fbc and _fbp.

4) GTM Server (or backend) — Meta CAPI (dedup with event_id)

If you have GTM Server:

Create a CAPI tag that listens for the same events via the Client and forwards to Meta with:

event_name: Lead or CompleteRegistration (map from your web event).

event_id: {{event_id}} (same ID from web to deduplicate).

event_time: UNIX seconds.

user_data: hashed email/phone, fbc, fbp, IP, UA (when available per consent).

custom_data: value, currency, care_level, etc.

If you don’t have GTM Server: implement a small server function or use a connector (Segment/Tealium/etc.).

5) Google Ads — Offline & ECL

Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL)

In Google Ads → Conversions → your web lead action → Enhanced Conversions → Turn on → Manual mapping (from GTM).

Offline conversions (deposits, move‑ins)

Capture and store gclid/gbraid/wbraid, event_id, and identifiers in the CRM from the original lead form.

Import later via Data Manager, CSV, or API with proper conversion name/time/value.

Use values for value‑based bidding (proxy → actual when available).

6) Meta — Offline outcomes (Datasets)

In Events Manager, create a Dataset and associate it with the ad account.

Upload (manually, scheduled, or via partner) rows with event_name, event_time, value/currency, and hashed identifiers (email/phone) plus fbc/fbp when available.

Map move‑ins and deposits to standard Purchase or a custom event.

7) QA checklist

Google: Tag Assistant → verify conversion tags & enhanced conversions payloads; Conversions → Diagnostics.

Meta: Events Manager → Test Events (see Pixel & CAPI events; dedup indicated by “Received from Browser and Server” with one counted).

Calls: Confirm website call conversions are logging (duration threshold met).

Consent: Toggle CMP choices and confirm Consent Mode updates; conversions should model per policy when denied.

8) Governance & privacy

Hash emails/phones with SHA‑256 client or server‑side before sending (never send raw PII in tags).

Respect user consent; withhold user_data when ad_user_data is denied.

Avoid transmitting any health/diagnosis details; restrict to marketing‑safe parameters (care level category, city).

How to connect everything (clear, cited steps)
1) Link GA4 ↔ Google Ads

Linking enables shared audiences, reporting, and (optionally) GA4 events in Ads.
GA4 Admin → Product links → Google Ads links → Link.

2) Turn on Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL) for web forms

ECL lets Google match hashed first‑party form data (email/phone) to the ad click—improving conversion modeling and bidding.

Option A (GTM): follow Google’s GTM guide to enable Enhanced Conversions for Leads and map hashed inputs. 
Google Help

Option B (Google tag/gtag.js)—if not using GTM. 
Google Help

If you prefer a low‑code connection, Data Manager in Google Ads provides a guided flow for ECL imports. 
Google Help

The GTM Implementation Spec file shows exactly how to push event_id, value, and hashed identifiers from the dataLayer and map them in the Google Ads tag.

3) Implement Consent Mode v2 before any tags

Configure consent in a Consent Initialization tag; default to denied and update after user choice.

Developer reference and guide (ad_storage, analytics_storage, ad_user_data, ad_personalization).

Note: ad_user_data is required for measurement use cases like enhanced conversions; ad_personalization controls remarketing. 
Google Help

4) Track website phone calls with Google forwarding numbers (DNI)

Create a Website call conversion in Google Ads and implement the snippet (or via GTM). Calls placed to your swapped number after a click will count as conversions; set a sensible duration threshold (e.g., 60s).

5) Import offline conversions (deposits & move‑ins) to Google Ads

Use our CSV template (above) or automate via API: include GCLID (or GBRAID/WBRAID), Conversion Name, Time, Value, Currency.

6) Set up Meta Pixel (browser) + Conversions API (CAPI) (server) with dedup

Install Pixel and verify with Test Events in Events Manager.

Send the same event name + event_id from both browser (Pixel) and server (CAPI) to deduplicate. Include _fbp / _fbc and hashed email/phone to boost Event Match Quality. 
Facebook

Follow Meta’s CAPI best practices (IDs and hashing improve matching). 
Facebook Developers

The GTM spec includes a dataLayer and tag blueprint for Lead (GenerateLead) and CompleteRegistration (ScheduleTour) with a shared event_id for Pixel+CAPI dedup.

7) Upload offline outcomes to Meta (Datasets)

Create a Dataset in Events Manager, associate it to your ad account, then upload deposit/move‑in rows (use our CSV). Include event_name, event_time (epoch), value, currency, hashed identifiers, and fbc/fbp when available.

8) Housing advertising compliance (Google & Meta)

Google Ads (HEC policy): U.S./Canada housing ads may not use ZIP code, gender, age, or parental/marital demographic targeting. Set all demographics to enabled and remove ZIPs.

Meta (Special Ad Category: Housing): declare the special category; age/gender/ZIP and certain detailed targeting options are restricted. Plan to rely on location radius, creative relevance, and first‑party audiences.

What your devs actually need to ship (high level)

Add the Consent Mode v2 snippet (from the spec) as a Consent Initialization tag in GTM.

Push dataLayer events on form success / tour confirm (payload & field names exactly as in the spec).

Create GTM Tags & Triggers:

Google Ads Conversion tags for GenerateLead, ScheduleTour, PricingRequest with Enhanced Conversions mapping.

Meta Pixel events with {eventID: {{event_id}}}; if using GTM Server, forward to CAPI with the same event_id.

Website call conversions snippet on pages with phone numbers.

CRM fields: store gclid/gbraid/wbraid, fbc/fbp, event_id, email, phone (raw for server hashing), care_level, city, timestamps.

Start offline uploads (Google CSV / Meta Dataset) for deposits & move‑ins using the templates above.

QA—what “good” looks like

Google Tag Assistant shows conversion tags with Enhanced Conversions payload (hashed identifiers present). Conversions → Uploads/Diagnostics shows accepted rows.

Meta Events Manager → Test Events displays one counted event per action with “received from Browser and Server (deduplicated)”.

Website calls: forwarding numbers swap on LPs; call‑length threshold reached and logged as conversions.

Consent: toggling CMP changes ad_user_data/ad_personalization; tags respect consent.

Bidding & campaign notes (how you’ll use the data)

In Google Ads → Conversions, mark ScheduleTour + Qualified Website Calls as Primary (bid to these) and observe GenerateLead/PricingRequest. Adjust as outcomes stream in.

Use value‑based bidding once proxy values are stable; then replace with real deposit/move‑in values from offline imports. (Performance Max for lead gen benefits when correct values + ECL are in place.)

Why this is tailored to Stage Senior

Your LPs and creative lean into genuine differentiators—local ownership, long‑tenured teams, chaplaincy, whole‑person care—which materially improves CTR and conversion quality across both platforms while complying with housing policies.

If you want, I can also drop this GTM spec into a container JSON (importable) and include sample GTM Server routes for Meta CAPI.

Great — here’s a clear breakdown of where to manage your conversion tracking and which platform to use for what, along with best practices for Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Google Tag Manager (GTM), and Google Ads (Ads).

Where to do what: platform roles
Platform	Primary Role	What you should set up there
Google Tag Manager (GTM)	Tag/trigger deployment — capture events & push to analytics/ads	Install tags (Google tag, conversion snippets, enhanced conversions), set up dataLayer variables/events, capture gclid/gbraid/wbraid and user identifiers.

Recommended workflow: how to use them together

In GTM, implement your tags/dataLayer:

Push events like ScheduleTour, GenerateLead etc. with parameters (value, care_level, gclid/gbraid, email/phone hashed).

Use GTM to fire Google Ads conversion tags and/or GA4 events.

Example: see GTM tag setup for Google Ads conversion tracking. 
Google Help

In GA4, track the same events:

Mark events that matter (e.g., GenerateLead) as Conversions in GA4. 
Google Help

Use GA4 for behaviour insight (paths, assisted conversions, multi-session impacts). 
analyticsmates.com
+1

Link GA4 → Google Ads (Admin → Product links) so data flows between them. 
Google Help

In Google Ads, set up conversion actions:

Create Conversion Actions for the key outcomes (Tour, Lead, Pricing Request, Phone Call, Deposit, Move-In). 
Google Help
+1

Choose which conversions will be used for bidding/optimization (mark as “Primary” or equivalent).

Import offline conversions (clicks → deposits/move-ins) or use Enhanced Conversions for Leads (email/phone hashed) for higher accuracy. 
Analytics Mania
+1

Use GA4 vs Ads reports appropriately:

Use Google Ads as your source of truth for campaign/keyword bidding and optimized decision-making.

Use GA4 for full-funnel analysis, multi-channel attribution, assisting behaviours. Because GA4 uses a different attribution model (focuses on time of conversion rather than click time) you’ll see differences. 
ClickPatrol
+1

Tag, test, validate:

After setup, use GTM’s Preview mode or Google Tag Assistant to test that tags fire correctly and capture parameters.

In Ads, check that conversion counts are appearing; in GA4, check that events and conversions are logged.

Expect some discrepancies between GA4 & Ads due to different counting/attribution logic.

Which conversions to set up where (for your landing page strategy)

Web-form completions, tour bookings, pricing requests, chat starts, click-to-call starts → track via GTM → fire both GA4 event and Google Ads conversion tag (or import via enhanced conversions).

Offline outcomes (e.g., deposit, move-in) → capture in CRM (with gclid/ids) → import into Google Ads (via offline conversion import) and optionally into GA4 if you want full-funnel.

Behavioural insights (scrolls, video plays) → track in GA4 for content optimization, but don’t necessarily use these for bidding in Google Ads.

Retargeting/remarketing audiences → build in GA4 (or Ads audiences) based on site behaviour → use in Google Ads and Meta.

Summary guidance & best practice

Always tag via GTM so you have flexibility and centralized management.

Use native conversion tracking in Google Ads for any action you plan to optimize/bid on — this prevents delays or inaccuracies caused by importing from GA4. 
OptimizeSmart Newsletter
+1

Use GA4 for broader analytic context — not solely for Ads bidding.

Link GA4 ↔ Google Ads so you share audiences, data flows, and you get consistent understanding across platforms.

Expect and plan for data discrepancies; treat GA4 and Ads as complementary tools vs. identical. 
ClickPatrol

Ensure call tracking, gclid capture, user-identifier hashing, and consent mode are implemented — these underpin reliable conversion capture.

If you like, I can pull together a visual decision-flow diagram (who sets up what: GTM → GA4 → Ads) that you can share with your dev/media teams so everyone knows exactly where their responsibility lies.

You said:
can any of this be setup via api?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 43s

Short answer: yes—almost everything you care about can be automated via API. Here’s the clean “who does what” map, with the exact APIs/endpoints you’d use and what (if anything) still needs the UI.

What you can automate (and how)
Google Ads (conversions, values, offline, ECL)

Create & manage conversion actions (web/lead/call/etc.)
Use Google Ads API → ConversionActionService (sample “Add Conversion Action”). 
Google for Developers
+1

Upload offline outcomes (tour → deposit → move-in) tied to clicks (gclid/gbraid/wbraid)
Use Google Ads API → ConversionUploadService.UploadClickConversions (or adjustments). 
Google for Developers

Enhanced Conversions for Leads (ECL) via API / Data Manager
ECL is supported in Google Ads API and Data Manager; it upgrades legacy offline import. 
Google Help
+1

Data Manager API (new) to send conversion/audience data with one call (supports confidential matching)
Use Data Manager API for sending lead/deal events to Ads. 
Google for Developers
+1

Note on website call conversions (DNI): you still enable the forwarding number feature and create the website-call conversion in the Ads UI; after that, you can read/operate via API, but initial setup is most reliable in UI. 
Facebook Developers

Google Tag Manager (deploy tags at scale)

Programmatically create containers, workspaces, tags, triggers, variables
Use GTM REST API (accounts.containers.workspaces.*), e.g., triggers.create, then publish. 
Google for Developers
+1

GA4 (linking, config, reporting—not bidding)

Programmatically link GA4 ↔ Google Ads
Use GA Admin API → properties.googleAdsLinks.create to create the link. (You can also link from Ads “Data manager” UI.) 
Google for Developers
+2
Google Help
+2

Automate GA4 property/config tasks (create properties, manage access, etc.)
Use GA Admin API (v1). 
Google for Developers
+1

Best practice: still send native Ads conversions for bidding, and use GA4 for analysis/remarketing; don’t rely on “import from GA4” for your primary bid signals.

Meta (Pixel/CAPI + offline)

Server-side events (CAPI) with dedup against Pixel by event_id
Use Meta Conversions API; send event_name, event_id, hashed identifiers, _fbc/_fbp. 
Facebook Developers
+1

Offline outcomes (deposits/move-ins) → Datasets
Upload/stream to a Dataset via Meta’s API; Meta retired the “Offline Conversions API” in favor of Datasets/CAPI. 
Facebook Developers

What I’d automate for Stage Senior (practical list)

Spin up GTM artifacts by script

Create tags/triggers/variables for: Google tag, Google Ads conversions (Lead, ScheduleTour, PricingRequest), Meta Pixel events, and the dataLayer variables (event_id, value, gclid/gbraid, fbc/fbp). GTM API. 
Google for Developers

Create conversion actions in Ads (one time)

ScheduleTour, PricingRequest, GenerateLead, Website Call (DNI), and placeholders for Deposit/Move-In. Google Ads API. 
Google for Developers

Enable Enhanced Conversions for Leads

Map hashed email/phone to your web lead conversions via Ads API/Data Manager; keep browser tags for redundancy.

Automate offline uploads (daily/near-real-time)

From CRM, push deposits & move-ins with value to Ads using UploadClickConversions (or via Data Manager API if you prefer single-pipe). 
Google for Developers

Stand up Meta CAPI

Send the same events server-side (Lead/CompleteRegistration), reuse event_id, include _fbc/_fbp + hashed identifiers; create a Dataset for offline outcomes. 
Facebook Developers

Programmatically link GA4 ↔ Ads (optional but nice)

Create/manage GoogleAdsLinks so audiences/remarketing are available without manual clicks. GA Admin API. 
Google for Developers

What still benefits from UI

Initial website call conversions (forwarding numbers): set up in Ads UI, then leave the counting to tags/API. 
Facebook Developers

Troubleshooting/Data Manager wizards: Google’s Data Manager UI is the simplest path to get ECL working; you can later move to API once stable. 
Google Help

TL;DR (decision rule)

Deploy & maintain tags → GTM API. 
Google for Developers

Create actions, upload offline/ECL, value-based bidding → Google Ads API / Data Manager API. 
Google for Developers
+2
Google for Developers

Link/configure GA4 → GA Admin API (optional), otherwise UI is fine. 
Google for Developers

Mirror to Meta → Meta Conversions API (web+server dedup) and Datasets for offline results.

If you want, I can draft a tiny Postman collection (Ads API + Data Manager + Meta CAPI) with sample bodies for: create conversion action, upload click conversion, send CAPI event, and create GA4↔Ads link.
