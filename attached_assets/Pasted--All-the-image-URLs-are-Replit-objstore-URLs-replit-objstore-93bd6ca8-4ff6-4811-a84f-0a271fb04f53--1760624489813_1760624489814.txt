 All the image URLs are Replit objstore URLs (/replit-objstore-93bd6ca8-4ff6-4811-a84f-0a271fb04f53/...). These URLs are from your
  development environment (Replit's object storage) and won't work in production!

  What's Happening:

  1. When you upload images in the production admin panel, they should be uploaded to production object storage (not Replit)
  2. But these URLs show they're pointing to Replit's development object storage
  3. That's why:
    - Images show in admin (because admin might proxy or handle these differently)
    - Images DON'T show on the public frontend (because the URLs are invalid in production)
    - Memory care images might appear if they were uploaded differently or cached

  The Fix:

  You need to re-upload the floor plan images in production, and make sure they're being stored in your production object storage (likely
  AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or similar), NOT Replit objstore.

  Let me check your upload configuration:

● Search(pattern: "OBJECT_STORAGE|R2_|S3_|CLOUDFLARE", path: "~/workspace")
  ⎿  Found 17 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "objstore|object.*storage", path: "server", glob: "*.ts")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(server/upload.ts)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines

● Perfect! I can see the issue. Your upload system uses Replit's object storage (lines 9-28), and it generates URLs like
  /${bucketId}/public/${filename} (line 259).

  In production, the DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID is set to replit-objstore-93bd6ca8-4ff6-4811-a84f-0a271fb04f53, which is your Replit
   bucket. This means even when uploading in production, images are being stored in Replit's object storage, not a production-appropriate
  storage solution.

  The Real Problem:

  Your production deployment is still using Replit's object storage which:
  - Works fine in Replit environment
  - Does NOT work when accessed from external production domains
  - These URLs (/replit-objstore-xxx/...) are internal to Replit and not publicly accessible

  Solution:

  You need to configure production to use a proper cloud storage solution. Check your production environment variables:

  # Production should have these set to a public cloud storage:
  DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID=your-production-bucket
  PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=['/your-bucket/public']

  Where is your production site hosted? (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, etc.) You'll need to set up either:
  - AWS S3
  - Cloudflare R2
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Or another cloud storage with public URL access

  Once that's configured, you'll need to re-upload all the floor plan images through the production admin so they get stored in the
  correct location.
