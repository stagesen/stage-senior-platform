There’s still a space for fun, and finding enjoyable activities for <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/services/memory-care/"" id="""">memory care residents</a> can be beneficial for their cognitive function and emotional well-being.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Memory care activities can include music therapy, gardening, cooking, and more</strong>. Here are 10 ways for your loved one to get the most out of their time in <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/our-neighborhood/community-map/"" id="""">our community</a>!</p><h2 id="""">The Importance of Engaging Activities</h2><p id="""">Activities designed for memory care residents are more than just ways to pass the time. They’re vital tools that can help improve cognitive abilities and <a href=""https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/daily-care/activities"" id="""">boost emotional health</a>.</p><p id="""">It’s essential to keep in mind that every individual is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Additionally, some activities can be more difficult for certain levels of dementia. Try a variety of activities and keep an eye on your loved one’s reactions to determine which ones are most suitable.</p><h2 id="""">1. Music Therapy</h2><p id="""">Music has the power to unlock memories and emotions like few other things can. Playing familiar songs from your loved one’s past can spark joy and nostalgia, potentially stirring up long-forgotten memories. Music therapy can also include sing-alongs or simple instrument playing, providing a creative outlet and social interaction.</p><h2 id="""">2. Sensory Bins</h2><p id=""""><a href=""https://dailycaring.com/6-alzheimers-sensory-activities-reduce-anxiety-without-medication/"" id="""">Sensory bins</a> are filled with objects of different textures, scents, and colors. They can stimulate the senses and promote cognitive engagement. These bins can be themed around seasons, holidays, or any subject that might resonate with the residents, providing not just mental stimulation but also a topic for conversation.</p><h2 id="""">3. Gardening</h2><p id="""">Participating in gardening, whether in an outdoor garden or with indoor plants, offers both physical activity and the satisfaction of nurturing life. Gardening activities can be tailored to the individual’s mobility and skill level, so everyone can enjoy the beauty and tranquility of connecting with nature.</p><h2 id="""">4. Board Games &amp; Puzzles</h2><p id="""">Puzzles are a fantastic way to engage the brain in problem-solving. From jigsaw puzzles to crosswords, they can be adapted to suit your loved one’s abilities and preferences. If your loved one likes board games, they’re great for <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191126140413.htm"" id="""">improving memory and cognitive skills</a>. Some residents may have a soft spot for classic games, but there’s also a whole world of more recently published board games with a wide range of themes, complexity, and designed with accessibility in mind.</p><h2 id="""">5. Art &amp; Craft Projects</h2><p id="""">Creating art allows for expression and creativity without the need for words. Art projects can be as simple as coloring or as complex as building and painting, depending on the resident’s interest and ability. These activities not only foster creativity but also improve fine motor skills.</p><h2 id="""">6. Memory Books</h2><p id="""">Developing memory books involves compiling photos, mementos, and stories from the resident’s life. This activity provides an opportunity for reminiscence and can be a comforting bridge to past experiences while encouraging conversation and connection with others.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672b800879b26becb8ffcc51/67b4b74eb39b571a4fb1fccc_10-Activities-For-Memory-Care-Residents-Supporting.jpeg"" alt=""A senior woman smiling and removing the lid of of a pot on a stove"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">7. Cooking and Baking</h2><p id="""">Participating in cooking or baking allows people to engage in a familiar and rewarding activity. Preparing simple recipes together can stimulate the senses, evoke memories, and result in a delicious shared experience. Making food together and providing food to the people you love is an ancient human activity, and satisfies a fundamental social need.</p><h2 id="""">8. Simple Exercise Routines</h2><p id="""">Physical activity can be adapted to the abilities of memory care residents, such as gentle yoga, walking, or chair exercises. Getting up on your feet is about more than physical health, exercise can significantly improve mood, balance, and independent functioning, contributing to a better quality of life.</p><h2 id="""">9. Pet Therapy</h2><p id="""">Who doesn’t like animals? Visits from furry friends can bring immense comfort and joy to memory care residents. Pet therapy sessions, whether with visiting animals or resident pets, offer companionship and unconditional love, <a href=""https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-does-pet-therapy-benefit-people-with-dementia-98677"" id="""">reducing stress</a> and promoting a sense of well-being. Many memory care residences provide dedicated pet therapy services with scheduled visits from professionals.</p><h2 id="""">10. Group Discussions</h2><p id="""">Organizing group discussions around topics of interest to the residents can foster a sense of community. This could include book clubs, film groups, or discussing current events. Even individuals with significant memory impairment can enjoy listening to others and interacting to the best of their ability.</p><h2 id="""">Thriving in Memory Care</h2><p id="""">Incorporating these memory care activities into the lives of residents can help them feel more in control of their lives. Each activity is designed to provide stimulation, joy, and a sense of accomplishment, contributing to a fuller, more vibrant life experience.</p><p id="""">At <a href=""/"">Stonebridge Senior</a> we’re committed to providing our residents with engaging, beneficial activities tailored to their needs.

It’s a new year for many in senior living communities, assisted living or nursing homes here in Arvada, Colorado and across the nation. If you have a loved one, it’s the time to help them transition into the new year with great anticipation of the good things to come. Start by letting them know that you will be there for them, whether by frequent visits, phone calls or fun surprises in the mail. Just because the holidays are over doesn’t mean that excitement needs to end. It’s time to invite Grandma or Uncle out for coffee and set some goals for 2022.</p><p id="""">Figure out what they need. Before you and your loved one develop some great goals together, touch base with their care givers, medical providers or staff who frequently assist with their every day needs. Perhaps your loved one is in memory care and has a specialized team caring for them. It’s a good idea to understand their immediate needs and the goals of their providers. Here are some ideas to discuss.</p><p id="""">Wellness. If your senior is going through rehab in some way, it’s possible to help them achieve partial or complete recovery. Or consider memory care. Daily cognitive activities recommended by their providers can significantly help those with dementia or Alzheimer’s. Once you get on the same page as the team providing their care, you will have a better idea of goals in this area for the new year. If Grandma is recovering from a stroke, you could practice their daily exercises and activities with them and decide on a final goal – being able to go out to their favorite restaurant for a meal together, or a visit to your home. Something that would be motivational but also a very realistic goal to achieve together. It’s important to work towards something that is actually achievable for them. Perhaps your loved one has something in mind they would like to work towards.</p><h4 id="""">Participation</h4><p id="""">If your senior has the opportunity to be part of an assisted living or senior community, find out how support services and planned community events can help. An environment that helps keep those in retirement living as independently as possible with assistance as needed can offer them dignity and grace as they age. Pair that with social opportunity to help them live a rich and fulfilled life, and they will have the balance and hope they need to enjoy the new year. You can even encourage them to participate in their community’s planned social events by attending with them as possible. Check with the hospitality desk before making any decisions as visitation rules may change on a daily basis due to health risk concerns.</p><p id="""">Identifying a special interest. It can be very beneficial for a senior to have an interest or hobby they love to work with every day this year. You can help them identify an activity that they would enjoy, and help get them set up. They may enjoy writing, crochet, gardening or something else very specific. Find out what makes them happy. Discuss past hobbies they have had and carefully watch for the thing that makes their face light up as they talk about it. Now you’ll have something you can inspire them with, put specific items on the birthday and Christmas gift list, and have fun discussing when you visit or talk on the phone. If gardening comes to mind, you can try something as simple as growing a miniature indoor flower or cactus garden. Find out what their assisted living home would recommend. They may even have a community possibility for them to be involved in. Writing can be very inspirational and spark some interest in passing down stories or wisdom to another generation. All they need is a way to put their thoughts into writing, whether by recording, a laptop or some other method that enables them to create their story. Sometimes little things can help them achieve their goals such as optimized vision or hearing. They may not even identify these challenges themselves, or realize that they could even be improved. So work with their health team to ensure best health. The Denver area has much to offer in terms of medical support, so be sure they have the resources they need.</p><p id="""">Having some simple goals to work towards together can make all the difference to help keep your loved one interested and inspired. It just takes a little effort, but you can work together as a team and come up with a plan. Let them know that you will be there for them throughout the year – not just during the holidays. Be their cheerleader as they accomplish goals and embrace the new year!</p><h3 id="""">More Resources</h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.americangeriatrics.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/HIA-TipSheet%20NYE19.pdf"" id="""">Top 10 Healthy New Year's Resolutions for Older Adults</a><br><em id="""">healthinaging.org</em></p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

Her children and grandchildren always thought of something out of the ordinary to make her day brighter. And this May was no exception. Judy lived in an assisted living home with caring, warm staff. They always had wonderful things to chat about each morning when they came to assist her with showering and getting dressed for breakfast. Today, Judy was excited to talk about the outing with her family. Her son and daughter-in-law had picked her up and taken her to a beautiful park for a family picnic. And the grandkids even brought their beloved family dog, Coco along. It had been a while since Judy had a dog herself, and it brought back so many memories. Just watching the dog dance and play on the green grass with so much energy made Judy’s day. She was excited as she told her caregivers about the dog. Coco had even come up to Judy and let her pet him several times. He was so soft and warm, she remembered.</p><p id="""">Dogs are special. They can bring so much joy to seniors. There’s a reason that dogs are often used as therapy or service animals. Some say that spending time with a dog can lower stress levels and improve health overall. But many seniors do not feel capable of caring for a pet anymore or fear a dog would outlive them if they were to get one. That’s where family can help. If you have a dog or puppy that is gentle in nature and appropriate with people outside their family, consider taking them along on your next family outing with Grandma. First, make sure your elderly loved one is comfortable around dogs and would enjoy watching the dog play or petting and interacting with him. Here are some considerations for introducing Coco to your senior.</p><p id="""">A pet friendly home. Check with your senior’s assisted living or nursing home and find out where pets are allowed. Ask if there is an area outdoors in their senior community or nearby where you could spend some time together with Coco. If not, it’s always possible to take a little outing to a local park or even a pet friendly restaurant. Colorado has many outdoor opportunities and Arvada has a few pet friendly dining options. You can use the Bring Fido app to find the perfect location, including restaurants with outdoor patios welcoming dogs.</p><h4 id="""">Allergies</h4><p id="""">If your senior has an allergy to your pet, bringing Coco along to your family outing will likely not be recommended. However, you still have options. Snap some pictures of your beloved family dog to share with Grandma or Grandpa or show them a video of the puppy playing with the grandkids!</p><p id=""""><a href=""/living-options/memory-care"">Memory Care</a>. If your loved one is part of a Memory Care program, talk to their caregivers and find out if a gentle introduction to the family pet might be beneficial. Some seniors with Alzheimer’s, dementia or other memory deficits may not be able to spend much time away from home, so plan accordingly and have a plan B in place in case Grandpa wants to cut the visit short or does not enjoy being around the dog. On the other hand, the dog may bring back memories and even bring some comfort and joy into their day.</p><p id="""">Dog therapy programs. If you do not have a pet to share with your loved one and feel that they could benefit from being around one, you can reach out to a dog therapy program. Trained therapy dogs can make visits to hospitals, nursing homes, senior centers and many other places. These therapy dogs can brighten up almost anyone’s day and can be a source of assistance perhaps even to your senior.</p><p id="""">Just a little planning and preparation can help enable you to share Coco with your loved one. Spring and summer are wonderful seasons to be outdoors enjoying nature, and the perfect time to watch a puppy play while soaking up the sunshine. Bring some joy into your senior’s life with the help of Coco this year!</p><p id="""">‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

I lost my keys. I can’t remember if I took my medications today. Is this a sign of something terrible?”. If you are still at a young age, you might be thinking this sounds a lot like your life. Not a big deal. But for someone in their senior years, there is always the nagging thought that it could signal something more significant. Perhaps dementia or Alzheimer’s disease slowly catching up? It is important to have the proper health care professionals involved to ensure that nothing is missed. In the meantime, it’s important to keep mentally vital. There are so many ways to keep an engaged and active mind. Here are some activities that may keep you or a senior family member interested and mentally stimulated.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Brainstorming</em></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Apps. Time to get an IPad. They are very practical when it comes to installing an app and besides, Ipads are like a big phone to play with. Only now you have larger text and a larger screen for activities. Check out cognitive apps for adults. These can range from games to something educational. It’s never too late to learn something new! Becoming familiar with a new devise such as an IPad or laptop can train your mind to work with something new as well. Ask a younger family member to help get you set up. They can help you find an app you can enjoy and set it up for you to use.</li><li id="""">Family. Staying engaged with kids and grandkids can be not only rewarding, but also mind stimulating. Sharing a hobby or discussing current events together can be a great way to start. Be open to thinking about different view points and perhaps topics that wouldn’t usually interest you. Don’t be afraid to reach out to a family member and ask for help. If you have been dreaming about going to a concert, sports event, a stroll in the park or a drive around town to look at old places, tell your family. They want to be part of your life and this can be very enriching for family as well. Being in a nurturing environment is important to feel secure and happy. Don’t hesitate to reach out.</li><li id="""">Groups. If there aren’t already groups in your community, there are ways to start one. Groups can range from book clubs to playing cards or chess or even something more creative, like art or croqueting. If this isn’t an option, consider actively engaging in conversation during meal times with neighbors, friends or family.</li><li id="""">Education. If socializing isn’t your thing, consider becoming engaged in something new all by yourself. Start learning a new language with simple games or apps on your IPad. Even if you only learn a few words at a time, it’s ok. Making progress at learning something new is great to keep the mind focused and also brings some satisfaction during long days.</li><li id="""">Physical activity. Taking walks or doing physical activity that has been approved by your doctor helps keep the blood flowing to vital areas including the brain. Besides, being outdoors and breathing in some fresh air is uplifting and inspiring. Talk with your health care providers about ways to add some exercise to your daily routine. Perhaps a water activity class is available in your area. If taking walks in the neighborhood is getting old, consider going on weekly outings with friends or family to explore a new area for a stroll around town, a nature path or a park. Colorado is a great place to get out in nature. The possibilities are endless.</li></ul><h4 id="""">Family is key</h4><p id="""">If you are a family member, it’s important to connect with your loved one’s healthcare providers to understand how to best support their prescribed treatment plan. For example, a person who had a stroke may require specialized care to help increase neurological stimulation to a damaged area of the brain. You could be a key part of a patient’s recovery if you follow directions. It could be as simple as the physician recommending you stand on the same side of a patient where they are experiencing deficits when talking to them to encourage movement on that side. Or perhaps a patient who has recently been diagnosed with dementia would benefit from specialized cognitive training. See how you can be involved. These can be special moments that you and your elderly family member will always treasure. Just remember that it’s important to connect with the doctors involved in your family member’s care. Everyone is different and may have a different prescribed course of treatment or care.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Keep moving forward!</em></p><p id="""">Discover what works for you. Talk it over with your health providers and family to help guide you in choosing suitable activities. Talk to a coordinator in your nursing home or assisted living community about opportunities and your specific needs. Ask to speak with someone who specializes in memory care. Never give up. Always keep moving forward and learning new things!</p><h3 id="""">More Resources</h3><p id="""">Use these quick resources to learn more about inspiring your loved ones to improve their memory!</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.alzheimers.net/11-5-14-brain-training-games"" id="""">8 Brain-Training Games for Memory</a><br><em id="""">Alzheimers.net</em></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-do-brain-games-improve-memory/"" id="""">Mayo Clinic Minute: Do Brain Games Improve Memory?</a><br><em id="""">Mayo Clinic</em></p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

But hearts were warm at the assisted living community where Bettina lived. Today was Thanksgiving! Normally, Bettina celebrated Thanksgiving with her family. And this year was no different. Her nephew promised to come pick her up and take her home to their family dinner. They knew just how she loved her cranberry sauce – the jellied kind. And her favorite pecan pie for dessert. But today wasn’t the only day to celebrate. All week, she had gotten together with friends from her assisted living community to celebrate together. There were fun decorations everywhere and the smell of pumpkin pie, turkey and gravy filled the hallways. Friends, family – community.</p><p id="""">Seniors across Colorado look forward to Thanksgiving and the following Christmas festivities with great anticipation. It might be the only time they get to see some of their family. And of course, it’s always fun for them to receive gifts, even small ones. It’s the season they are reminded that their family cares for and loves them. In fact, this may be the time of year that fills seniors with hope and expectation to get through the entire year. Of course, its always important to stay connected with your senior and celebrate each season and holiday year-round. But the magic and warmth of Thanksgiving and the Christmas season touch the hearts of seniors and children alike. Here are some ways you can make sure your loved one remains healthy and included this year.</p><h4 id="""">Community</h4><p id="""">If your loved one has the opportunity to live in an assisted living or nursing home, they likely have many tools available to them to keep them interested all year long, with an abundance of social events as well as mental and physical fitness activities. For those with Alzheimer’s or dementia, a Memory Care program may be just the resource they need at their senior community to help give them mental stimulation. Senior communities can give your senior the chance to live life as independently as possible while having a community of friends as neighbors. Your senior’s community is likely decorated for each holiday, with seasonally appropriate activities for residents to participate in. Find out what’s on the schedule for this month, and encourage your loved one to be part of all the festivities this year!</p><p id="""">Family. No matter what living situation your senior calls home, you should know that family will always mean the most to them. They’ll be proud to introduce you to their friends or caregivers. They may keep pictures of their children and grandchildren nearby. A visit from family members can brighten up any fall or winter day, especially if you bring along their favorite homemade pie! You may also consider inviting Grandma or Grandpa to your family Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner this year. Although many Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, just remember to keep your loved one as safe as possible by limiting their exposure to anyone who might be sick. It’s also the flu season, so be vigilant about keeping seniors protected from sick family members, especially children. Talk to your senior’s caregiver’s and doctors to see how to best accommodate and include your loved one this year.</p><p id="""">Virtual Visits. If you don’t live close to your senior family members or if you are sick, you can still connect by phone calls, video visits or a nice holiday card. Staff and caregivers can assist your senior in facilitating these calls if needed. If you would like to connect with your senior on a regular basis, find out what technology could be beneficial to give as a Christmas gift this year. Do they need an upgraded smartphone? An iPad or laptop? With virtual technology, your whole family can be involved in wishing Grandma a merry Christmas no matter where you are in the world!</p><p id="""">This year, bring the warmth and love of the season to your elderly loved ones in the way that is safest and best for you and your senior. Sometimes, it’s the small things you can do to remember them and show love that brings them the most joy. That home baked apple pie. A video visit with the grandkids. Encouraging them to attend a holiday activity with their friends. Stay safe and healthy this year and help your senior enjoy life to the fullest!</p><h3 id="""">More Resources</h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/holidayseason/index.html"" id="""">12 Ways to Have a Healthy Holiday Season</a><br><em id="""">cdc.gov</em></p><p>‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

Colorado, with its vibrant cities like Arvada and Denver, has become a beacon for those seeking quality assisted living options. This article delves into the myriad benefits of <strong id="""">choosing assisted living in the Centennial State, highlighting how these communities are redefining elderly care through a blend of independence, nurturing assistance, and specialized services.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><h2 id="""">Tailored Assistance in a Supportive Community</h2><p id="""">Assisted living communities are designed to offer seniors the right balance between living independently and receiving the help they need with daily tasks. These communities provide personalized care plans that include assistance with medication management, bathing, dressing, and other personal care needs, ensuring each resident receives the exact level of support they require.</p><h2 id="""">A Focus on Quality of Life and Independence</h2><p id="""">One of the core benefits of assisted living is the emphasis on maintaining residents’ independence. Senior apartments and living spaces are equipped to allow aging in place comfortably, with modifications and support readily available as residents’ needs evolve. This setup ensures that seniors can continue to lead fulfilling lives, with their dignity and autonomy respected.</p><h3 id="""">Nurturing Environment for Alzheimer’s and Memory Care</h3><p id="""">Memory care is a specialized segment of assisted living that focuses on the needs of individuals with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Communities are equipped with secure, structured environments that reduce stress and confusion for residents. Skilled and licensed caregivers provide targeted activities and therapies designed to preserve cognitive functions and enhance quality of life.</p><h3 id="""">The Community Aspect: Beyond Just Living Spaces</h3><p id="""">Assisted living communities are more than just places to live; they are vibrant communities where seniors can forge meaningful connections. Regularly scheduled activities, social gatherings, and communal dining areas encourage interaction and help prevent the isolation often experienced by seniors living alone. This sense of community is vital for emotional and mental well-being.</p><h3 id="""">Comprehensive Care Options</h3><p id="""">Beyond custodial care, many assisted living communities in Arvada, Denver, and across Colorado offer a continuum of care services. This includes transitioning from independent living to more intensive nursing home care or skilled nursing care as a resident’s health needs change, providing a seamless care experience that can adapt to each senior’s evolving requirements.</p><h3 id="""">Emphasis on Nutrition and Wellness</h3><p id="""">Nutrition plays a crucial role in senior health, and assisted living communities pay special attention to providing well-balanced, nutritious meals that cater to the dietary needs and preferences of residents. Moreover, wellness programs focusing on physical activity, mental stimulation, and preventive health care support overall well-being.</p><h3 id="""">Cost-Effective Solution for Long-Term Care</h3><p id="""">When compared to the costs associated with in-home care services or the intensive care provided at nursing homes, assisted living often emerges as a cost-effective alternative. It consolidates living expenses, care costs, and lifestyle amenities into one monthly fee, simplifying budgeting for seniors and their families.</p><h3 id="""">The Colorado Advantage</h3><p id="""">The natural beauty and healthy lifestyle associated with Colorado add another layer of appeal to its assisted living communities. From the picturesque local views of the Rocky Mountains to the clean air and outdoor activities available in cities like Arvada and Denver, residents have the opportunity to enjoy a high quality of life that is both physically and mentally beneficial.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672b800879b26becb8ffcc51/67b4bcbabd0d645ccca30f42_LJID-Ralston-Creek-Exterior-9-26-16-Dusk-Entry-89mb-320x211.jpeg"" alt=""Ralston Creek Neighborhood"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">Setting the Standard for Caregiving</h2><p id="""">If you have an aging senior in Colorado and seek to explore senior living options,<a href=""/contact-us""> contact</a> Stonebridge Senior for more information or<a href=""/schedule-tour""> schedule a tour</a> to experience our community and supportive care services.</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

You are ready to discuss your parent embracing the next chapter of their life in an assisted living community. This journey can be filled with lots of emotions. So, take a deep breath, embrace the chaos, and get ready to dance into this new chapter with style.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 1: The Decision Dance</strong></h3><p id="""">Convincing your parent that it’s time to transition to assisted living can feel like a tango – sometimes graceful, sometimes a little clumsy. A gentle conversation is a good place to start. Highlighting the perks of senior living, you can say something like: “Mom, imagine living in a community where your neighbors are all fabulous friends, and you never have to mow the lawn again!” You can remind them of the great location of Denver, Colorado: the fresh air, and the nearby mountains &nbsp;– oh and the chance to show off their knitting skills to all their new friends.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 2: Touring the Oasis</strong></h3><p id="""">Now it’s time to tour <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/article/assisted-living-vs-memory-care-which-is-right-for-your-parent/"" id="""">potential assisted living communities</a>. Think of it as house-hunting, but with more bingo. Look for vibrant community life, delicious food, and a range of activities. If your parent loves bridge, find a place where bridge tournaments are a staple. And if they have Alzheimer’s or need memory care, ensure the community has specialized support to keep them safe and engaged.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 3: The Great Declutter</strong></h3><p id="""">Once <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/article/exploring-the-benefits-of-assisted-living-in-colorado-a-focus-on-senior-care-in-arvada-and-denver/"" id="""">a community has been selected</a>, next comes the epic declutter. This is where the real fun begins. Turn on some tunes from your parent’s heyday, and get ready to sift through decades of treasures (and some bizarre finds). That old lava lamp? Perhaps a keeper. The pile of old TV Guides? Maybe not. Remember, it’s all about making their new senior apartment feel like home, without the clutter.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 4: Packing with Panache</strong></h3><p id="""">Decluttering flows smoothly into packing. And packing can feel like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. Turn it into a quirky scavenger hunt. “Find the photo of Dad dressed as Santa!” It’s all about keeping the mood light. Make sure to pack essentials and a few cherished mementos to make the new place cozy.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 5: The Big Move</strong></h3><p id="""">The moving day itself can be a whirlwind. Hiring some skilled-care movers can help ease the stress, or if costs are prohibitive, rally the family troops. Keep a checklist to ensure nothing gets left behind. Remember, moving can bring up a lot of emotions. Allow time to let your parent feel their feelings and accept them where they are at. Offer light-hearted and humorous responses when appropriate. For example, you could pick up a TV remote and direct the movers like a maestro with your “baton”. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 6: Settling In</strong></h3><p id="""">Once your parent is settled in their new assisted living digs, it’s time to explore! Attend the welcome tea, join a community event, or simply take a stroll around the grounds. Introduce them to neighbors and staff – a nurturing environment makes the transition smoother. And don’t forget to sample the food – most communities or facilities take pride in their culinary offerings. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Step 7: Ongoing Support</strong></h3><p id="""">Moving into assisted living doesn’t mean your role is done. Remember your parent will continue to have emotions after the move, but don’t be surprised if the adjustment is quick and positive! You can provide ongoing support and reassurance via regular visits, phone calls, and even participating in activities together. Stay connected with the staff to hear how they are doing when your parent doesn’t know you are watching.</p><p id=""""><a href=""/"">Stonebridge Senior</a> location in Arvada, Colorado has an extra layer of charm.

It is a disease that can be very challenging for seniors, their families, and caregivers. As dementia develops, it can have a significant impact on an individual’s ability to communicate. In addition to memory loss, dementia can also cause significant mood shifts and, in some cases, paranoia, all of which may impact a senior’s ability to communicate effectively. </p><p id="""">As a caregiver, family member, or friend of someone with dementia, you may feel frustrated or overwhelmed when trying to communicate with your loved one. <strong id="""">However, there are some strategies that may improve your communication and help support a strong relationship with your loved one. </strong></p><p id="""">If you’re struggling to communicate or care for a loved one with dementia, it may be worth considering transitioning them to a <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/"" id="""">senior living community</a>.

It is also important to keep in mind that dementia does not affect everyone in the same way, and some seniors may have more trouble communicating than others.</p><p id="""">Some tips for <a href=""https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/daily-care/communications"" id="""">communicating with seniors with dementia</a> include:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Be respectful</li><li id="""">Show empathy</li><li id="""">Avoid arguing or correcting</li><li id="""">Listen attentively</li><li id="""">Speak clearly and slowly</li><li id="""">Use visual cues </li><li id="""">Maintain eye contact</li></ul><h3 id="""">Be Respectful</h3><p id="""">It is important to be respectful when talking to a senior who has dementia. Make sure to treat them with dignity and respect, and avoid talking down to them or speaking in a patronizing manner. Remember that they are still adults with their own unique personalities and life experiences. </p><h3 id="""">Show Empathy</h3><p id="""">Seniors with dementia may experience confusion, frustration, or anxiety, which can make communication difficult. Show empathy and understanding by acknowledging their feelings and responding with compassion. Be patient during your conversation, and don’t take any out-of-character behavior personally. </p><h3 id="""">Avoid Arguing or Correcting</h3><p id="""">It can be tempting to correct a senior with dementia when they say something that is untrue or incorrect. However, arguing or correcting them can lead to frustration and agitation. Instead, try to redirect to a more positive or neutral topic of conversation. </p><h3 id="""">Listen Attentively</h3><p id="""">Listening is an important part of any conversation. Be attentive and responsive to what the senior is saying, even if it does not make sense to you or seems unrelated to the topic you are discussing. Avoid interrupting or correcting them, and try your best to understand what they are trying to communicate. </p><h3 id="""">Speak Clearly and Slowly</h3><p id="""">When talking to a senior with dementia, it is important to speak slowly and clearly. Use simple language and short sentences. Give them time to process and respond to what you’re saying. Be patient, and don’t rush them. </p><p id="""">Try to ask “yes” or “no” questions as opposed to open-ended questions. For example, instead of asking, “What would you like for breakfast?” ask “Would you like oatmeal for breakfast?” </p><h3 id="""">Use Visual Cues</h3><p id="""">Some seniors with dementia may respond well to visual cues. Use gestures, facial expressions, and hand signals to convey your message, Point to objects or pictures when speaking, and use visual aids to help them understand what you are saying. For example, if you are discussing medication, show them the bottle or pill box.</p><p id="""">In some cases, seniors may also benefit from you writing down questions or parts of your conversation for them to read. </p><h3 id="""">Maintain Eye Contact</h3><p id="""">Eye contact is another key part of communication. Maintaining eye contact can help a senior with dementia feel more connected to the conversation and help them focus on what is being said.

Pam always enjoyed seeing family and friends and all the little gifts and cards that trickled in every day leading up to Christmas. It was a time of year she always looked forward to. But this year, even as the Christmas decorations were being taken down, she was excited for the new year. Her son and daughter-in-law had tucked a card into her gift this year. They wrote about the new year to come and how they were planning to come visit again in January and take her out for lunch! And her grandsons promised to send her a video of their basketball games coming up. Life was moving on in a good way. Her family inspired her to get up each morning, do well with the exercises she was doing in her Memory Care program, and participate in her assisted living home’s social activities. And she kept her family’s Christmas cards right where she could reach them so she would remember when their next visits would be.</p><p id="""">As the year comes in an end and we welcome in 2023, it’s the time to look forward and continue to celebrate and anticipate. Seniors need to know that their family will continue to be there for them in the new year especially after the excitement of the holidays are over. Here are some ways to help them transition into a new year and keep the hope alive!</p><h4 id="""">Cards</h4><p id="""">Christmas cards are always fun, especially when they include a heartfelt letter inside. But this year, consider adding a note about how you will continue to be involved in their life throughout the new year. Tell them you’ll be visiting often and give them some encouragement to embrace life at their assisted living or nursing home. “Keep up those daily exercises because we will be coming to take you out on walk often!” You might also consider doing something on a weekly basis with your senior such as lunch after church or Friday morning breakfast. Being involved in their life will continue to melt away the Arvada winter chills and bring some sunshine!</p><h4 id="""">Call them up</h4><p id="""">If you don’t live very close to Grandpa or have a busy schedule, phone calls can go a long way especially if you make the effort to connect with your loved one regularly. Consider calling at the same time each week. Talk with your senior’s caregivers to determine when a good time and day would be to give them a call. If your senior has difficulty with phone calls, they may be able to connect better using video technology. Ask those caring for your loved one to assist with these calls if necessary.</p><h4 id="""">Encourage participation.</h4><p id="""">Life at a senior home can be beneficial to help keep your loved one interested and socially stimulated in addition to the personal and medical care they might receive. When you visit next time, encourage your senior to participate in as many daily activities as possible. Find out if you can be involved in their memory care exercises or special events hosted by your senior’s assisted living home. With flu season in full swing, it’s important to check with the hospitality desk about any precautions currently in place to help keep everyone at the community safe. Elderly care is something every family member can participate in, even if it’s just spending time together and sharing some good food.</p><p id="""">Even though all the excitement of the holidays are over, you can continue to be there for your loved one and show them how much you want to be involved in their life throughout the new year. With our busy schedules, it’s important to take a minute to recognize priorities and be there for those seniors in our life who would appreciate our love and care. Family will always mean the world to them! And if you are a friend, you’ll can also make a huge difference to an elderly person. Little things can mean so much. </p><p id="""">Make 2023 their best year yet!</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource
Labor Day: planning a party,labor-day-planning-a-party,672b800879b26becb8ffcc54,672b800879b26becb8ffcc0f,67b4bdf1ad3e53ad176c8788,false,false,Tue Feb 18 2025 17:05:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Feb 18 2025 17:05:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Feb 18 2025 17:05:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),jennie-dreiling,Wed Aug 31 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672b800879b26becb8ffcc51/67b4bdc49ad04879849d3e44_RCN-august-22-article-pic-CustomWeb-640x427.jpg,,,,"<p id="""">It’s still warm out in <a href=""/life/arvada-guide"">Arvada</a>. With summer winding down, everyone wants to take advantage of any last summer parties. Labor Day tends to bring family or friends together one last time before school starts and life begins in full swing again. As you plan the weekend, here are some things to consider when inviting your elderly loved ones to join. With just a few extra considerations to add comfort and provide a safe environment, you’ll be able to host your senior with ease.</p><p id="""">Senior approved. It’s a good idea to make sure your family party or event will be appropriate for your senior. Abrupt or loud noises, too much commotion or pets may make your senior uncomfortable, especially if your loved one is part of a memory care program due to Alzheimer’s or dementia. Talk to your loved one’s caregivers and see what level of tolerance they might have when introduced to a new environment. Watching a backyard game or petting the family dog may just bring them some extra joy or these things may be a cause of anxiety.</p><p id="""">Provide them with extra comfort. If your party is outdoors, consider your senior’s individual needs. A padded patio chair, the ability to sit in the shade and the opportunity to easily have access to a bathroom are all things to keep in mind. In the summer heat, it’s important to stay hydrated too. Many elderly people are no longer mobile, so make sure hydrating drinks are readily available to them and easy to access. Some skin sensitive sunscreen is always great to have on hand for them as well in case they forgot to bring their own!</p><h4 id="""">Limit number of guests</h4><p id="""">Although vaccinations are widely available and pandemic guidelines for gatherings are no longer as restrictive, it’s a good idea to remember that there are still health risks to keep in mind. Make sure guests attending your party are aware that a senior will be attending your event. Ask guests to make sure they are healthy. It’s possible to suggest guests take a Covid-19 test before coming to your event. Keeping your party small and inviting just a few guests can help limit your senior’s exposure to illnesses too.</p><p id="""">Serve food they’ll enjoy. There is nothing like hamburgers fresh off the backyard grill or homemade apple pie and ice cream. Most likely your senior has memories of summertime dinners from years past. Everyone has a different idea of what constitutes the best backyard summer food. Is your senior come from the South? Or perhaps the Southwest? They may have some favorite dishes they have come to enjoy and anticipate over the years. Ask them what their favorite dessert or ice cream is!</p><p id="""">Keep it short. Your senior may be used to their assisted living community’s schedule with the opportunity to rest as needed. Or they may be in the care of a nursing home and no longer used to being out and about as much. Caregivers can give you some advice here and tell you if your loved one may tire quickly or are usually up for all of the social gatherings and events at their senior community. Have a plan B option ready in case your loved one needs to go home and rest earlier than you had planned. They’ll need a ride as well as some packed up leftovers of their favorite pie!</p><p id="""">After the party is over, reach out to your senior and spend some time remembering the good times you shared together. Bring along some pictures you took of that fun afternoon to give them. If they enjoyed coming to your party, consider inviting them to another little gathering this fall. Perhaps a small harvest party. They’ll look forward to it and you’ll be able to gage better how to make their next visit even more enjoyable!</p><p id="""">Seniors look forward to spending time with family, sharing good food and being surrounded by love. If your senior is lucky enough to live in an assisted living home or other type of senior retirement community, they likely enjoy socializing with their friends every day during community events. But something a little out of the ordinary involving family, the sunshine and all things summer is sure to give them something to remember for months to come. Make this Labor Day memorable for them!</p><p>‍</p><h3 id="""">More Resources</h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.medicare.org/articles/staying-cool-in-the-summer/"" id="""">Staying Cool in the Summer</a><br><em id="""">medicare.org</em></p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

This was the case when a senior resident decided to give a piano lesson to another senior resident here at Stonebridge Senior. Neighbors helping neighbors. This piano lesson was a perfect example of how sharing one’s talent and passion can bring joy and purpose to both the giver and the receiver. It is a reminder that we are never too old to learn or teach, and that a shared love of music can bring people together regardless of age or ability.</p><p id="""">Being part of a senior community can provide a powerful sense of belonging and support for older adults. As people age, they may experience changes in their living situations, social networks, and physical health, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Senior communities offer a solution to this problem by creating a supportive and inclusive environment where residents can form meaningful connections with others who share similar interests and experiences. By participating in community events, engaging in conversation with neighbors, and taking advantage of the various amenities available, seniors can build strong relationships and feel a sense of belonging which can be invaluable in the later stages of life.</p><h4 id="""">Opportunity</h4><p id="""">An assisted living community can offer amazing socialization opportunities for older adults looking to connect with others in their age group, like these residents did. These communities are designed to provide a safe and comfortable environment where seniors can live as independently as possible while still having access to a range of social activities and amenities. From organized group events like movie nights, game nights, and fitness classes, to casual gatherings in communal areas, there are plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with other residents. This can be especially beneficial for older adults who may be experiencing loneliness or isolation, as socialization has been shown to have positive effects on mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, being part of a senior community can provide a sense of belonging and support, which can be invaluable in the later stages of life.</p><p id="""">Socialization can be incredibly beneficial for seniors with memory deficits such as Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Engaging in social activities can help stimulate the brain, keeping it active and sharp. Studies have shown that regular socialization can help slow down cognitive decline and even delay the onset of dementia. Socialization can also help with memory retention by providing opportunities for seniors to engage in conversation, reminisce about past experiences, and form new memories. Socializing with others can improve the overall quality of life for seniors with memory deficits, reducing feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. By interacting with others and participating in group activities, seniors can maintain a sense of purpose, identity, and connection to the world around them, which can be incredibly beneficial for their overall well-being.</p><p id="""">The heartwarming story of our resident at Stonebridge Senior giving a piano lesson to another resident highlights the importance of fostering social opportunities for older adults. Senior communities can offer a variety of activities and amenities that allow residents to connect with one another and form meaningful relationships. From organized events to casual gatherings, these opportunities for socialization can have a positive impact on mental health and overall well-being, particularly for those with memory deficits such as Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. By providing a sense of belonging and support, a senior community can enhance the quality of life for older adults, promoting greater independence, happiness, and fulfillment.</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

The warmer weather, birds singing and flowers popping up bring joy to many seniors in Colorado and across the nation. Even though retirement is well under way, many seniors still remember looking forward to fun summer days. That excitement is still in the air. Now, their kids are grown and have families of their own. If you have a loved one in an assisted living or nursing home, be sure to reach out and help them experience the hope that Spring brings us every year.</p><p id="""">Nature. While your loved one may live a very comfortable life inside their cozy senior living home, it’s important to make sure they get out and experience the changes in nature. Plan a visit and encourage them to take a short walk in the fresh air. If they are wheelchair restricted or cannot walk very far, make sure to grab an extra blanket to bundle around them and choose a place to walk that is wheelchair accessible. Feeling the gentle warm breeze, the warm sunrays and noticing the colorful spring flowers popping up can bring so much comfort. You also get to spend time together. Many assisted living communities have walking paths or areas for residents to enjoy the outdoors. You could also consider going on a little outing to a park or garden if your loved one is able to tolerate longer day trips.</p><h4 id="""">Easter Decoration</h4><p id="""">Spring and Easter go hand in hand. There is hope and excrement in the air. Help your senior decorate their home with a few colorful Easter pieces. It could be something small like a tablecloth in spring colors and an Easter basket packed with some goodies of course. Or a doormat with bright flowers and sunshine. Sometimes its little things that go a long way to brighten up a senior’s day. Always check to see if your loved one may have their own collection of seasonal decorations they may love. It may be just a little too much effort for them to pull out their beloved treasures and offering them some assistance may mean the world to them. It also gives you the opportunity to visit a bit and make sure they are doing well emotionally as well. And check in with their caregivers.</p><p id="""">Bright yellow and pink. Flowers bring color and sunshine into our lives. Spring flowers come in all colors from shades of red to pinks and oranges and yellows. Plan a fun surprise and put together a bright flower basket filled with colorful tulips or daffodils. Your loved one can water the flowers every day and watch them continue to bloom. It’s a great way to bring the season indoors to them, especially if they spend most of their time inside their home. A pop of color and the smell of spring flowers can do wonders to brighten up days even when it’s still fairly cold outside. If your senior is less mobile, a bouquet of bright pink tulips in a vase will probably be more manageable for them to care for.</p><p id="""">Small gifts. Colorful items frequently used can be fun surprises to bring along to your next visit. A light pink jacket, some soft pajamas or a bright blanket can go a long way to cheer grandma up. If it’s grandpa, try a new hat filled with colorful chocolate easter eggs. Or a new coffee mug. Fill their home with just a few splashes of color to remind them that Spring is here! For those with Alzheimer’s or memory impairment in <a href=""/living-options/memory-care"">Memory Care</a>, touch base with their caregivers and find out what special items would be beneficial for them. Perhaps a simple brightly colored spring themed puzzle or book would be helpful and fun for them.</p><p id="""">March is the time to start looking forward to all the good times ahead. Families are typically busy making summer plans, wrapping up school years and enjoying some outdoor activities. Be sure to bring the joy this season brings to your senior loved ones this year. Tell them about your plans and activities and send lots of pictures. Bring some color and sunshine into their lives!</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

It’s the perfect time of year to ensure that seniors are getting out in nature, basking in the sunshine and staying connected with family. Colorado offers a whole host of outdoor opportunities. If you’re wondering how to plan your next visit, here are some activity ideas to inspire you and your senior.</p><p id="""">A stroll outdoors. Spending time outdoors surrounded by nature can be a wonderful experience for seniors. It’s a great way to get some fresh air and sunshine while enjoying the beauty of the natural world. While some seniors may need a bit of encouragement to venture outside, short walks or sitting in a wheelchair can still be enjoyable for them. Many retirement communities offer outdoor areas for their residents, such as walking paths or patios with benches for resting. If your senior is able to handle longer outings, consider taking them to a nearby park or nature reserve. It’s important to remember to pack appropriate clothing and accessories, such as light jackets, blankets, and cushions, to ensure their comfort during the outing. With a little bit of planning, being out in nature with a senior can be a delightful experience for both of you.</p><h4 id="""">Brunch in the sunshine.</h4><p id="""">Having brunch outdoors with a senior can be a wonderful way to enjoy some fresh air and sunshine while sharing a delicious meal. It provides an opportunity to connect with your loved one in a relaxed and comfortable environment, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Consider finding a restaurant with an outdoor patio or even bringing a picnic to a park or lake. Make sure to bring any necessary items, such as a cushion or blanket to ensure your senior’s comfort. It’s important to find some shade so your senior isn’t in the direct sun for long periods of time. Eating a meal or having coffee outdoors can be pleasant experience for the senses, but it also helps to promote healthy eating habits and socialization, which are both important for a senior’s overall well-being.</p><p id="""">Exercise. Engaging in physical activities can be beneficial for seniors who are unable to take walks or enjoy outdoor activities. It is important to communicate with the caregivers about the daily exercises they have been doing with your loved one. Seniors with Alzheimer’s or dementia in a memory care program or those requiring specialized nursing care may benefit from smaller activities that can help increase their strength. Collaborate with care providers to establish goals and identify ways in which you can assist. Spending time with your loved one can be motivating, especially when they can demonstrate progress. Consider bringing your loved one a favorite snack to celebrate each small accomplishment.</p><p id="""">Engaging in community activities. During your next visit to see Uncle Ray, make sure to obtain a schedule for the upcoming month from the activities center. Assisted living or senior communities typically offer residents daily, weekly, or monthly activities as well as special events to take part in. Encourage your loved one to participate and inquire if there are any events in which you could also join. While family members are often welcome, there may be restrictions due to Covid or other seasonal precautions. Take time to talk with your senior about past events and their favorite experiences.</p><p id="""">Bringing spring to them. Living in anticipation and hope can be a wonderful experience. Bright and cheerful colors, as well as seasonal decorations, can bring joy to seniors within the comfort of their own homes, starting from the moment they wake up each morning. Consider treating Grandma to a pedicure in a bright pink shade or presenting her with a bouquet of sunshine yellow tulips. A basket of Easter chocolates wrapped in vibrant foil is not only enjoyable but also delicious! For those residing in memory care or assisted living, a set of brightly colored crayons or markers with an adult coloring book can be a fun and relaxing activity. Caregivers can provide guidance and help identify activities that would be beneficial for your senior loved one this season.</p><p id="""">There are numerous small but meaningful ways to bring happiness and positivity into the life of your senior loved one. This spring, it is important to ensure that they feel valued and cherished. Although they may be receiving excellent care in an assisted living or nursing home, family always holds a special place in their heart and life. A little bit of extra effort such as visiting them, making a phone call, or writing a heartfelt note can significantly brighten up their day. Just a little effort can help make spring a time of brightness and warmth for our cherished seniors!</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

Terry was fortunate enough to live in a wonderful assisted living home and had great access to healthcare. Her family checked in regularly with her care team so they could all be on the same page. Every day she participated in the daily activities and social events provided by her community. She loved socializing with her neighbors. Today, she was going to see her doctor to talk about getting the flu vaccine as well as a booster for Covid-19. She didn’t want to be sick over the holidays!</p><p id="""">Do you have a loved one who lives in an assisted living or nursing home? Or perhaps they have Alzheimer’s or dementia and require a memory care program. It’s wise for anyone to take extra precautions during the fall and winter months, but it is especially important for the elderly. While seniors living in an adult community have the advantage of being sheltered with extra health precautions in place as directed by the health department, there is always going to be some amount of exposure to the outside world. Seniors love having family members visit and enjoy outings. Here are some ways you can help keep your family member healthy and safe this year.</p><h4 id="""">Visiting tips</h4><p id="""">Your loved one’s assisted living community will need to keep up to date with the latest CDC and state health department guidelines, so they may have temporary restrictions or extra precautions when it comes to visitors. It’s always a good idea to touch base with the hospitality desk before visiting your loved one to see how you could best help protect the community from spreading illness. It’s best to stay home if you have any symptoms of an illness even if you think it’s just the common cold. Children often have frequent exposure to viruses and bacteria from childcare and school settings and must be monitored closely for any potential symptoms if you are taking them to visit Grandma or Grandpa. An illness that is mild to you may be extremely detrimental to your senior and can spread to others in their community. It’s best to be safe and reschedule a visit if you are unsure. Video visits and phone calls can help bridge the gap when your family is sick.</p><p id="""">Vaccines. It’s flu season and vaccines are becoming available. You can help protect yourself and your family from spreading the flu by getting vaccinated. Make sure your senior understands the health benefits of the various vaccines offered to them and encourage them to follow their provider’s medical advice. Covid-19 booster vaccines may be a good consideration for those who are advised to get it.</p><p id="""">Testing. Vaccines do not guarantee that you won’t become ill. So be on the lookout for any signs that you could be contagious. If you have been exposed to someone with Covid-19, consider taking a Covid-19 test before visiting an adult community.</p><p id="""">Basic prevention. Experts say it’s important to make sure you wash your hands frequently to prevent the spread of illness. When you arrive at your loved one’s nursing home, it’s easy to quickly wash your hands before giving them that big hug. If your senior is especially health compromised, you might consider wearing a mask in addition. Touch base with caregivers and your senior’s doctor to see what extra measures you should take to help keep them safe.</p><p id="""">Outings. Do you want to invite your elderly loved one to your family Thanksgiving dinner? It may be the highlight of their year. And with Covid-19 restrictions largely lifted, gathering to celebrate the holidays is becoming a reality for many families. Consider advising your guests that a senior will be attending your family dinner so extra effort should be made that everyone coming is healthy. You might also limit the amount of guests you invite to your holiday party this year out of consideration for your senior guests.</p><p id="""">Let’s work together to make sure our seniors have their best year yet! Just a few health precautions can make a world of difference. Enjoy all that fall and the upcoming holidays have to offer this year and share that excitement and love with your senior!</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

It’s a wonderful time of year in Colorado. For many families, it’s the time to enjoy pool parties, backyard BBQ’s and fun vacations. And if you have a senior in an assisted living or nursing home, the warm breezes and sunshine likely will remind them of past memories with their family. So as you enjoy the season, remember to spend some time with your senior loved ones. They’ll be so thankful. Here are some ideas to help your senior enjoy this summer.</p><p id="""">A visit. Many senior communities offer activities and social events for their residents. Stop by one morning after they’ve had breakfast and look over the community events schedule together. Talk about upcoming events and encourage them to attend. They’ll likely tell you about their friends and activities they’ve enjoyed in the past. Help them look forward to a fun summer! See if you can attend one of the events with them. Many retirement communities encourage family involvement, but with Covid-19 causing some restrictions based on current risk factors, it’s a good idea to check with the hospitality desk and see how you can be involved.</p><h4 id="""">Brunch</h4><p id="""">If your loved one is capable of short car rides, consider getting the whole family involved in preparing a special brunch or luncheon for them at your house. It could be out on the patio, or indoors with windows wide open to let the breeze in. Make sure to provide them with a comfortable chair and plenty of shade. Find a summery table cloth and add some flowers to make the table cheerful and bright. It will mean so much to them that you made the effort to do something special for them!</p><p id="""">Celebrate. It’s almost Independence Day. Help them celebrate the season by bringing by a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers, some tiny flags and a slice of apple pie! You can help your senior celebrate the summertime anytime. Cut some fragrant garden roses to bring to them or find a fun beachy picture to hang on their wall. A few summery items will help brighten their day and bring them joy for days!</p><p id="""">Food. Grandma may have a favorite pie or dessert she especially enjoys in the summertime. It may a specific kind of ice cream or strawberry shortcake. Surprise your loved one with something homemade, just for them! You can also share your family favorites with them. And next time you have a family cookout, make up a plate for them complete with BBQ chicken, potato salad, baked beans and a slice of pie!</p><p id="""">Plan a fun activity. Bring summer to your senior by sharing a fun activity to do with them at their assisted living home. For example, you could help them with a pedicure using fun summer shades for them to choose from. Or watch a movie with summertime themes. Work on a puzzle together with a bright beach picture. You may need to get creative especially if your senior is no longer very mobile.</p><p id="""">For those in memory care with Alzheimer’s or dementia, it’s important to speak with caregivers to find out how you can help brighten up their summer. Your senior may not be able to venture out far, or may require special accommodations. Find out the things that are enjoyable for them. If your senior enjoys looking at pictures, bring an iPad and share pictures of the family vacation to the beach with them. Your senior’s caregiver may also share some activity ideas or exercises you could help out with. Spending time with your loved one is so important, regardless of whether or not you have to adjust your plans a bit.</p><p id="""">Summertime is busy and fun. Many seniors are no longer mobile or able to get out and about to enjoy seasonal activities. If your loved one lives in an adult community where they receive supportive care, they will likely have access to planned activities, holiday celebrations, a fitness program and social events. You can also share summer with them and help bring some sunshine into their life! And they will be so happy you thought of them.</p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

However, due to their <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/article/10-signs-your-elderly-parent-needs-help/"" id="""">evolving abilities and healthcare needs</a>, they often require increasingly more assistance. Families tend to be the first to step up to care for their aging parents, but frequently they don’t know what options are even available for senior-focused care.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Beyond supporting your parents’ continued living in their home, your senior care options can include independent living, assisted living, </strong><a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/services/memory-care/"" id=""""><strong id="""">memory care</strong></a><strong id="""">, and hospice care. </strong>Each has pros and cons, so it’s essential to include your parents in a conversation about their living situation and needs.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding Care Options for Aging Parents</h2><p id="""">Many senior community options offer medical support, social opportunities, and specialized care. It’s this specialization that often sets communities apart, so it’s crucial to thoroughly research and consider the best options for your loved one.</p><h3 id="""">Independent Living</h3><p id="""">Independent living is an excellent option for seniors who are still active and can manage most of their <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470404/"" id="""">daily activities</a>. These communities offer a range of amenities, such as housekeeping, meal services, and recreational activities, all designed to enhance the quality of life for seniors. </p><p id="""">One of the main benefits of independent living is the opportunity for social interaction. Seniors can engage in community events, join clubs, and make new friends, all of which are crucial for their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, these communities often have on-site medical services, ensuring residents have easy access to healthcare when needed.</p><h3 id="""">Assisted Living</h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/services/assisted-living/"" id="""">Assisted living communities</a> provide a middle ground between independent living and more intensive care options. These communities offer support for daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and medication management, while still allowing residents to maintain independence. Assisted living communities also provide social activities, transportation, and on-site healthcare services.</p><p id="""">These communities are attractive for many families because they offer a safe and supportive environment without the full-time commitment required by home care. Residents can enjoy <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/our-neighborhood/pricing/"" id="""">various amenities</a>, such as fitness centers, libraries, and dining services—all of which contribute to a higher quality of life.</p><h3 id="""">Specialized Memory Care</h3><p id="""">Specialized <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/services/memory-care/"" id="""">memory care communities</a> provide the necessary support and supervision for seniors with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.

However, this arrangement requires careful planning and open communication to ensure that everyone’s needs are met.</p><p id="""">Before moving your parents in with you, consider your home’s space and accessibility, caregiving responsibilities, and financial considerations. Living with family can strengthen bonds and provide a sense of security for elderly loved ones. However, to maintain a harmonious living arrangement, it’s crucial to have regular check-ins and address any challenges that arise.</p><h3 id="""">Maintaining Independence at Home</h3><p id="""">For many seniors, aging in place is the preferred option. Living at home allows them to maintain their independence and stay connected to their community. However, ensuring their safety and well-being requires careful planning and support, such as making adjustments to their home to improve safety and accessibility.</p><h3 id="""">Home Care Services</h3><p id="""">Home care services allow seniors to receive personalized care in the comfort of their own homes. This option is ideal for those who prefer to stay in familiar surroundings but require assistance with daily activities.

Thanksgiving with Aunt Suzi,thanksgiving-with-aunt-suzi,672b800879b26becb8ffcc54,672b800879b26becb8ffcc0f,67b4bc3171812e420e2b249f,false,false,Tue Feb 18 2025 16:58:25 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Feb 18 2025 16:58:25 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Feb 18 2025 16:58:25 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),jennie-dreiling,Fri Nov 19 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672b800879b26becb8ffcc51/67b4bc0b6b161aafc29ab3f4_RCN-pic-nov-article-Web-640x425.jpg,,,,"<p id="""">Today was a very special day for Suzi. She lived in an assisted living home and had the opportunity to participate in the home’s memory care program. She began having some issues with memory several years back, and her loving family had ensured she had all the resources necessary to continue living life to the fullest. Suzi didn’t realize that the snow dusted lawn of her beautifully landscaped outdoors in Arvada, Colorado was the start of the holiday season, or that Thanksgiving was today. In fact, she was quite amazed to see her nephew Alex loaded with Thanksgiving goodies. He even remembered her Thanksgiving favorite – southern pecan pie.</p><p id="""">Alex served his Aunt Suzi a slice of pecan pie and sat next to her, wondering if she would recognize him. As she took a bite of the pie, memories of her childhood down south flooded back and she began telling him stories of her childhood. She seemed so happy, and so secure as she talked about her parents and the old farmstead. Suddenly she turned to him and said, “Alex, you need some pie too!” A big smile swept across Alex’s face. She remembered him.</p><p id="""">Thanksgiving is the season to celebrate. To be thankful. For seniors, it can be a long awaited time to see family members and share some good times and food together. It’s something out of the ordinary, out of the regular routine of life. For many seniors, it’s the highlight of the entire year. Whether your senior is in assisted living, memory care or still living on their own, you can bring so much joy into their life. Here are some things to consider to keep everyone safe and yet feel loved this holiday season.</p><h4 id="""">Virtual Visits</h4><p id="""">Virtual visits can be a great option if you live far away or want to limit exposure for health reasons. Make sure your senior has access to technology such as an iPad or laptop with a camera and microphone. It’s really important that elderly family feels remembered and appreciated, especially at this time of year. Seeing your family interact in your home, grandkids showing off their accomplishments or latest interests, and the family puppy wagging and waiting with anticipation for a piece of turkey will bring a smile to their faces.</p><p id="""">Seeing family is very important for most people, especially in their senior years. If you live nearby and your loved one’s home is in a retirement or senior living community, make sure to check and see what visitation allowances are in place at the time. At this time, CDC and state health guidelines especially for the elderly can vary based on the current risk of acquiring Covid-19 or the flu. So be sure to call ahead and ask what current policy is in place for family to visit. Sometimes, visits can be facilitated in a setting such as outdoors with proper distancing and masks in place. You can also ask about bringing some home cooked favorite holiday for your loved one. If health concerns are not an issue, you may consider bringing your senior into your home to share good Thanksgiving dinner. Be sure to consult CDC and local health recommendations, and perhaps even talk to your senior’s doctor about best options. To limit your loved one’s exposure to large gatherings, consider hosting a smaller Thanksgiving a day or two ahead of time, just with your elderly family member.</p><p id="""">However you plan to celebrate Thanksgiving this year, remember the seniors in your life and bring them the warmth and love of this holiday season. It’s quite likely that they have been looking forward to this time of year with great anticipation. Visit, call them up, try a video visit, or bring them something they’ll enjoy. Joy and gratitude are the theme of the season!</p><h3 id="""">More Resources</h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://states.aarp.org/mississippi/managing-the-holidays-for-seniors"" id="""">Managing the Holidays for Seniors</a><br><em id="""">aarp.org</em></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/holidayseason/index.html"" id="""">12 Ways to Have a Healthy Holiday Season</a><br><em id="""">cdc.gov</em></p><p>‍</p>",jennie-dreiling,Resource

Recognizing the <a href=""https://www.agingcare.com/articles/loneliness-in-the-elderly-151549.htm"" target=""_blank"" id="""">warning signs of loneliness</a> in seniors, whether they reside in their own homes, senior apartments, <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/"" id="""">assisted living communities</a>, or skilled nursing, is crucial for their well-being. Here are some key indicators to help you identify loneliness in seniors and provide the necessary support and assistance.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding Loneliness in Seniors</h2><p id="""">Loneliness in seniors can stem from various factors, including the loss of a spouse, family members living far away, or the transition to a new living environment like a nursing home, assisted living community or senior apartments. Seniors with <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/services/memory-care/"" id="""">Alzheimer’s or other memory care</a> needs may be especially vulnerable to feelings of isolation.</p><h2 id="""">Warning Signs to Watch For</h2><h4 id="""">Withdrawal from Community and Social Activities</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">One of the most telling signs of loneliness in seniors is their withdrawal from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=862341922578219&set=pcb.862341942578217"" target=""_blank"" id="""">social activities</a> and community engagement. Whether they live in adult communities or independently, a noticeable decrease in participation in social events, hobbies, or group activities can indicate feelings of isolation. Encouraging involvement in local community activities can help alleviate loneliness.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Changes in Eating Habits</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Loneliness can significantly impact a senior’s appetite and eating habits. If your elderly loved one shows disinterest in food, eats significantly less, or has noticeable weight loss, it may be a sign of emotional distress. Assisted living communities or facilities and nursing homes often provide communal dining experiences to foster social interaction during meals.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Neglecting Personal Hygiene</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">A sudden neglect in personal hygiene, grooming, or the upkeep of their living space can be an indicator of loneliness or depression. In <a href=""https://www.ralstoncreekneighborhood.com/our-neighborhood/photos/"" id="""">assisted living</a> and senior apartments, custodial and skilled care staff can help ensure that these aspects are managed effectively, providing a nurturing environment for seniors.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=""""> Increased Memory Issues and Cognitive Decline</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Loneliness can exacerbate cognitive decline, especially in seniors with Alzheimer’s or other memory-related conditions. Memory care programs in senior living communities offer specialized assistance to support seniors facing these challenges, ensuring they receive the attention and care they need.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Frequent Health Complaints</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Seniors experiencing loneliness often report more frequent health issues, such as headaches, aches, or other chronic conditions. These complaints might be a cry for help and an indication that they need more social interaction and supportive care. Regular health check-ups and supportive care in nursing homes and adult communities can help address these concerns.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Emotional Changes</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Significant changes in mood, such as increased irritability, sadness, or anxiety, can be signs of loneliness. If your senior loved one expresses feelings of worthlessness or being a burden, it’s crucial to address these concerns immediately. Maintaining regular communication with your elderly loved ones, whether they live independently or in a senior living community, is essential for their emotional well-being.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Depressive Symptoms</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Loneliness can lead to depression. Look for signs such as persistent sadness, lack of energy, and a disinterest in life. This is particularly important for seniors in custodial and skilled care environments where close observation is possible.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Lack of Purpose of Interest</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Seniors who feel lonely may exhibit a lack of purpose or interest in life. They might stop engaging in activities they once enjoyed or seem disinterested in their surroundings. Encouraging them to participate in meaningful activities and providing assistance in finding new interests can help them regain a sense of purpose.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="""">How to Help</h2><h4 id="""">Foster Connections</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Encourage regular visits, phone calls, or video chats with family and friends to help seniors feel connected. </li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Encourage Participation</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Motivate them to join social activities or clubs in their community or assisted living community.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Utilize Local Resources</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Locally in Arvada and Denver, and throughout the state of Colorado, there are numerous resources for elderly care and supportive care. Engage with local senior centers and organizations that offer companionship programs.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Consider Professional Help</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">If loneliness seems to be affecting their mental health significantly, consider seeking help from mental health professionals who specialize in elderly care.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="""">Explore Senior Living Options</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><ul id=""""><li id="""">Research options like memory care, assisted living, or senior apartments that offer a nurturing and supportive environment.
