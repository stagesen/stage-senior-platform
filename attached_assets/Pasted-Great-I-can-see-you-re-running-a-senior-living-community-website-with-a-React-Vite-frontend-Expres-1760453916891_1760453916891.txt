Great! I can see you're running a senior living community website with a React/Vite frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database. You have
  multiple communities (Golden Pond, Gardens at Columbine, Gardens on Quail, Stonebridge, etc.) and are looking to create a dynamic landing page
  system that integrates with Google Ads API.

  Let me brainstorm a comprehensive strategy for you:

  Google Ads + Dynamic Landing Page System: Strategic Approach

  1. Architecture Overview

  The system would work in three layers:

  A. Google Ads Integration Layer
  - Connect to Google Ads API to pull campaign data, keywords, ad groups, and geo-targeting info
  - Track Quality Score, expected CTR, and landing page experience metrics
  - Monitor search terms that trigger your ads

  B. Dynamic Landing Page Generation
  - Create template-based pages that auto-populate based on:
    - Location (Golden, Denver, Aurora, etc.)
    - Intent ("Assisted Living Near Me", "Memory Care", "Independent Living")
    - Community (Golden Pond, Gardens at Columbine, etc.)
    - Care Type (from your existing careTypes table)

  C. Optimization & Tracking Layer
  - A/B testing different layouts, headlines, and CTAs
  - Heatmaps and conversion tracking
  - Quality Score monitoring and automated suggestions

  2. Database Schema Additions

  You'd need new tables:

  // Landing page templates
  landingPageTemplates
  - id, slug, intent_keyword, care_type_id
  - template_type (location-specific, care-type-specific, hybrid)
  - hero_headline_template (e.g., "{care_type} in {city} - {community_name}")
  - cta_text, conversion_tracking_id

  // Google Ads campaign mapping
  googleAdsCampaigns
  - id, campaign_id, ad_group_id, landing_page_template_id
  - target_keywords, geo_targets, quality_score
  - tracking_url_template

  // Landing page performance
  landingPageMetrics
  - id, landing_page_url, campaign_id
  - visits, conversions, bounce_rate, quality_score
  - avg_time_on_page, tour_requests

  3. URL Structure Strategy

  I'd recommend SEO-friendly, intent-matching URLs:

  /assisted-living/golden-co          → Generic location page
  /assisted-living/golden-pond        → Specific community page
  /memory-care-near-me/golden         → Intent + location page
  /senior-living/golden/compare       → Comparison page

  4. Content Personalization Strategy

  Dynamic Elements to Match Ad Copy:

  1. Hero Section
    - Headline mirrors ad text: "Assisted Living in Golden, CO"
    - Subheadline addresses search intent
    - Background image from the relevant community
  2. Social Proof Positioning
    - Show reviews/testimonials filtered by community
    - Display your 4.8 rating prominently
    - "Licensed & Insured" badge
  3. Geographic Relevance
    - Map showing proximity to searcher
    - "Only 5 minutes from Golden" type messaging
    - Local landmarks and neighborhood info
  4. Price Transparency
    - Match starting price from your communities.startingPrice
    - Clear pricing CTA that addresses "how much" intent
  5. Urgency Elements
    - "Same-day tours available"
    - "Limited availability" (if true)
    - Live calendar integration

  5. Google Ads API Integration

  Key API Endpoints to Use:

  // Fetch campaign performance
  GoogleAdsService.searchStream({
    customerId: 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID',
    query: `
      SELECT
        campaign.id,
        ad_group.id,
        ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls,
        metrics.search_impression_share,
        metrics.quality_score,
        search_terms_view.search_term
      FROM search_term_view
    `
  })

  // Get keyword Quality Scores
  AdGroupAdService.getKeywordQualityScore()

  // Track conversions
  ConversionActionService.mutate()

  6. Optimization Workflow

  Step 1: Ad → Landing Page Matching
  - Parse UTM parameters: ?utm_campaign=assisted-living-golden&utm_term=assisted+living+near+me
  - Route to appropriate template
  - Log impression in your database

  Step 2: Content Optimization
  - Match headline exactly to ad headline (Google rewards this)
  - Use keyword in first 100 words
  - Include location in meta title and H1

  Step 3: Conversion Tracking
  - Fire Google Ads conversion pixel on tour request form submit
  - Track phone clicks as conversions
  - Send data back to Google Ads API

  Step 4: Automated Quality Score Improvement
  - Monitor pages with QS < 7
  - Auto-suggest content improvements
  - Flag slow-loading pages
