Making a Global Impact
Stage Cares embodies our commitment to creating positive change both within our communities and around the world. Through employee participation and company matching, we build a powerful foundation for supporting those in need and making meaningful impacts in diverse communities.
How Stage Cares Works
Our innovative giving program unites the power of employee generosity with corporate commitment. Employees contribute $5.00 per paycheck ($10 monthly), and Stage Management matches every dollar, creating a sustainable fund for supporting vital causes and responding to urgent needs.

Our Community - Helping Hands
Helping Hands is a non-profit organization formed to help individuals with unexpected life challenges. Stage Cares will have resources available for our own staff to apply for support via Helping Hands when unexpected circumstances arise.
