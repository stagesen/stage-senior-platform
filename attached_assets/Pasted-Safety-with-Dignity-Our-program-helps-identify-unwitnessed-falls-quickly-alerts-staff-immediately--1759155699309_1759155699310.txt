Why this matters:
Overnight and bedroom falls are common; speed and clarity change outcomes.

How it works
Activate (consent) → Detect (event‑based) → Notify (immediate) → Review (clear video) → Adapt (care plan & environment).

Frequently asked questions
Is my loved one always being recorded?
No. Monitoring is event-based only. The system records a short window before and after a detected fall. If no event is detected, nothing is recorded. All non-event video is automatically deleted within minutes.
Does this mean cameras are on all the time?
No. Cameras are installed in bedrooms only (never bathrooms or common areas) and are activated only with family consent. They are not live streaming. No audio is recorded at any time.
How does this improve safety?
Most falls in senior living occur in bedrooms, often overnight and unwitnessed. By detecting these events in real time, staff are alerted immediately—allowing faster assistance, fewer unnecessary ER transfers, and better follow-up care.
What happens after a fall is detected?
Alert: Staff are notified right away.
‍Response: Caregivers arrive quickly to help.
‍Review: The event is securely reviewed to understand what happened.
‍Adapt: Care plans and the environment are updated to reduce future risk.
‍Communicate: Families are kept informed, with clear explanations of what occurred and what steps we’re taking.

Can we opt in later or change our mind?
Yes. Participation is entirely optional. You may opt in at move-in or any time later, and you can opt out whenever you choose.
Does this replace caregivers?
Not at all. This feature is designed to support staff, not replace them. It provides additional “eyes” during unwitnessed times so staff can respond more quickly and accurately.
What benefits have other communities seen?
Independent studies show:
‍~ 40% fewer falls overall
~ Up to 80% fewer fall-related ER visits
~ 30 minutes faster average response times

These outcomes translate to fewer disruptions for residents and greater peace of mind for families.
Does this cost extra?
No. This is part of our comprehensive safety and care program at the Gardens on Quail. We believe enhanced fall safety is a standard every resident deserves.
How is this different from wearable devices?
Residents don’t have to wear or remember anything. Monitoring is discreet, accurate, and always on in the background—with no disruption to daily life.
Still have questions?
Our team would be happy to walk you through the program in person, show you how it works, and answer anything specific to your loved one’s situation.
