What Are Care Points?
Plain-English definition
Care Points are a simple way to price only the services your loved one actually receives. Each service (like medication management, bathing, or mobility support) is assigned a small point value. Points add up to a daily total, which translates into your monthly care cost.
Why this matters
You’re never pushed into a broad “tier” that includes services you don’t need. Your plan can move up or down with your loved one’s needs—and you’ll always see exactly why.

Benefit	Points-Based System (Us)	Tiered Levels (Many Communities)
Fairness & Transparency	You pay only for care actually provided.	You often pay for bundled services you don’t need.
Flexibility as Needs Change	Plans adjust up or down as needs change.	Small changes can jump you into a higher tier with a big price hike.
Personalized Care	Every plan is custom-built.	Broad categories feel cookie-cutter.
Easier Family Conversations	Clear menu of services and points.	Feels like pressure to accept unnecessary services.
Predictability	Any increase is tied to a specific, visible change.	Minor changes can cause large, unexpected increases.
Competitive Differentiator	Transparent, fair, resident-centered.	Tiers feel less flexible and less personal.

~33 pts
Bathing / showering — standby / safety supervision (1–2×/week) (~30 pts)

Hands-on dressing
Bathing setup & safety
Escorts to meals/activities
Care (~80 pts × $20) $1,600 + Base Rent (Assisted Living, Private Suite) $5,770 = Total $7,370

Enhanced Support

~120 pts
Bathing + dressing (hands-on)
Incontinence care
Assistance with transfers
Care (~120 pts × $20) $2,400 + Base Rent (Assisted Living, Private Suite) $5,770 = Total $8,170

Comprehensive Support
“Full-coverage help, day and night”

~160 pts
Incontinence care + transfers
Night safety checks
Memory cues & redirection
Care (~160 pts × $20) $3,200 + Base Rent (Assisted Living, Private Suite) $5,770 = Total $8,970

Why points beat tiers
No cliff pricing. Care changes in $20 steps, not $500–$1,000 tier jumps.
Resident-centered. Points follow recurring needs and can adjust up or down.
Transparent math. Total = Base Rent + (Points × $20). That’s it.
Figures shown are examples. Costs may change and are general estimates when published. Your exact plan is confirmed after a professional assessment.

Frequently asked questions
How do you determine the initial care points?
A nurse-led assessment measures the exact supports your loved one needs. We build the plan with you.
How often do points change?
We reassess as needs change or at regular check-ins. You’ll review and approve any adjustments first.
What if my loved one improves—or has a temporary setback?
Points go down when needs decrease. For short-term changes (e.g., post-hospital), we can set temporary plans and revisit.
Is medication management billed separately?
It’s included as points like any other support. We’ll show the exact point value and frequency.
Will I be surprised by increases?
No. We only change pricing when the plan changes, and we discuss it with you first.
Can we get a written menu of services and points?
Yes. We publish our menu and walk you through every line.
Do you offer both Assisted Living and Memory Care?
Yes—both use Care Points so your plan is always right-sized and transparent.
What’s my next step?
Use the estimator for a ballpark, then book a Pricing Consult to get your precise plan.

I'm a home health nurse with Envision and I have to say this is one of the best communities I get to visit.
