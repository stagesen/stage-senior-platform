        "question": "Can my loved one age in place if their needs change?",
        "answer": "Yes. Many of our communities offer multiple levels of care, from independent living to memory care. As needs change, we adjust the care plan rather than requiring a move to a new facility. This continuity provides stability and comfort during life transitions."

        "answer": "Care plans and pricing adjust as needs change. If your loved one needs more assistance, we increase the care level and adjust the monthly rate accordingly. If they need less help (like after recovering from surgery), the rate can decrease. You only pay for the care actually needed."
