## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Importing to Production
1. **Backup your database** - Import will overwrite existing data
2. **Test on staging first** - Don't run directly on production
3. **Verify image hosting** - Make sure all image URLs are accessible

### Image Upload Function
The import script includes a placeholder for image uploading at `scripts/import-community-data.ts:35`. You may need to customize the `uploadImageFromUrl()` function based on your image storage solution (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.).

Currently it creates database records with the provided URLs, but you may want to:
- Download images and re-upload to your storage
- Process/optimize images (resize, compress)
- Generate multiple sizes for responsive images

### Care Types & Amenities
The script automatically creates care types and amenities that don't exist. Make sure the freelancer uses consistent naming:
- "Independent Living" (not "Independent" or "IL")
- "Assisted Living" (not "Assisted" or "AL")
- "Memory Care" (not "Memory" or "MC")
