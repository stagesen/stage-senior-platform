    "overview": "Since 2004, Golden Pond has been a proud part of Golden, Colorado. We're deeply connected to the community — partnering with local schools, churches, and organizations — while offering independent living, assisted living, and memory care designed for comfort, independence, and care that grows with you.",
    "description": "**Locally Owned Excellence**\n\nGolden Pond is locally owned and managed, providing an upscale yet down-to-earth experience that feels like home. Most residents make Golden Pond their forever home — supported by compassionate staff, engaging activities, and chef-prepared dining.\n\nOur 98% resident satisfaction rate reflects what families already know: life here is golden.\n\n**Independent Living**\n\nNewly remodeled apartments feature granite countertops, stainless appliances, tile backsplash, and in-unit washer and dryer. Enjoy spacious one- and two-bedroom floor plans with community-wide Wi-Fi, Comcast Xfinity HD cable TV, and free transportation to doctor appointments.\n\nOn-site dining serves three chef-prepared meals daily, seven days a week. Transportation to stores, banks, churches, and restaurants is included, along with on-site medical services like physicians, podiatry, audiology, and radiology.\n\n24-hour emergency pull cord monitoring, all utilities (except telephone), bi-weekly housekeeping and linen service, and daily trash pickup round out our services. Residents stay active with fitness classes, card games, movie nights, lectures, and scenic drives.\n\n**Assisted Living**\n\nNewly remodeled apartments offer beautiful western views of the foothills or eastern views of North Table Mountain. Care includes 24/7 staff and RN oversight, individualized care plans, three meals daily, and weekly housekeeping and linen service.\n\nAll utilities are included — electricity, water, trash, cable, and phone. Daily trash service, free laundry rooms or staff laundry option, Wi-Fi, Comcast HD cable, and a 24-hour emergency system with optional pendant provide peace of mind.\n\nThird-party therapy services, on-site medical providers (physicians, podiatry, audiology, concierge physicians, radiology), scheduled transportation to appointments, and bus transportation to local stores, banks, and churches keep residents connected and cared for.\n\nActivities include fitness classes, card games, lectures, and scenic drives.\n\n**Memory Care – The Meadows**\n\nThe Meadows is a specialized, secure neighborhood offering individualized dementia care in a calm, supportive setting. With 15 private studio apartments, warm community spaces, and mountain views, The Meadows provides safety, connection, and dignity.\n\nNewly remodeled private studios include a secured courtyard with views of North Table Mountain, registered nurse oversight, mini refrigerators in every apartment, three daily meals, Comcast HD cable, Wi-Fi, and all utilities.\n\nA full activities calendar, inclusive care up to 150 points, weekly housekeeping and laundry, 24-hour emergency monitoring with optional pendant, on-site medical and therapy services, and newly remodeled dining and activity areas complete the experience.\n\n**Engaging Programs**\n\nOur art program encourages creativity and memory stimulation. Music therapy brings joy through familiar songs and rhythm activities. Memory-specific activities — from hallway bowling to goat yoga — keep life lively.\n\nA sensory room offers a calming, multisensory environment. The courtyard features heated paths and manicured gardens for safe outdoor time and events.\n\n**Dining Excellence**\n\nRestaurant-style dining seven days a week features chef-prepared meals using fresh, seasonal ingredients. Friday happy hour runs 4–5 p.m. with wine, beer, and cocktails available with meals.\n\nMonthly food committee meetings with residents, weekly chef specials, a la carte menu options, and holiday menus and themed dining events make every meal special.",
