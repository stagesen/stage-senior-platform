## Script Features

### 1. **Intelligent Parsing**
- Reads the markdown framework file
- Extracts campaigns, ad groups, and keywords
- Handles multiple match types per keyword
- Stops at RSAs section to avoid parsing non-campaign data

### 2. **Ad Copy Generation**
For each ad group, generates:

**Headlines (15 per ad):**
- Care type + Location: "Assisted Living in Littleton"
- Quality messaging: "Quality Assisted Living"
- Location focus: "Littleton Senior Living"
- Call to action: "Schedule Your Tour Today"
- Phone number: "Call (303) 436-2300"
- Value propositions: "Compassionate Care 24/7", "Beautiful Littleton Community"

**Descriptions (4 per ad):**
- Personalized care messaging
- 24/7 professional staff
- Beautiful facilities
- Engaging activities
- Resort-style amenities
- Community warmth

### 3. **Google Ads API Integration**
Uses the existing `google-ads-service.ts` with proper API calls:
- `createCampaignBudget()` - Creates daily budget in micros
- `createCampaign()` - Creates search campaign with Maximize Conversions
- `createAdGroup()` - Creates ad groups for each city/care type
- `addKeywords()` - Batch adds keywords with proper match types
- `createResponsiveSearchAd()` - Creates responsive search ads

### 4. **Budget Conversion**
Properly converts USD to micros (multiply by 1,000,000):
- $150/day ‚Üí 150,000,000 micros
- $75/day ‚Üí 75,000,000 micros  
- $30/day ‚Üí 30,000,000 micros
- $60/day ‚Üí 60,000,000 micros

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Continues processing even if individual operations fail
- Logs warnings for failed keywords or ads
- Provides detailed error messages
- Final summary report of successes/failures

### 6. **Safety Features**
- Campaigns start in PAUSED status for review
- Detailed console logging at each step
- Summary report at the end

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
**Google Ads API Permission Error:**
```
User doesn't have permission to access customer. 
Note: If you're accessing a client customer, the manager's customer id 
must be set in the 'login-customer-id' header.
```

**Solution Required:**
Set the `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` environment variable to the manager account ID if accessing a client customer account. The script is ready to run once credentials are properly configured.
