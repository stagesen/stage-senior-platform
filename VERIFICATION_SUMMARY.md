- **Purpose:** Automated script to check floor plan image coverage
- **Features:**
  - Queries all active floor plans across all 4 communities
  - Checks for image_id references
  - Verifies image existence in images table
  - Checks for legacy imageUrl usage
  - Checks floor_plan_images junction table for additional images
  - Generates comprehensive report

### 2. Ran Verification
- Executed the script against the database
- Generated detailed report with statistics and specific issues

### 3. Created Documentation

- **Raw Output:** `/home/runner/workspace/floor-plan-verification-report.txt`
- **SQL Queries:** `/home/runner/workspace/floor-plan-image-queries.sql`

## SQL Query Used (As Requested)

```sql
SELECT 
  c.name as community,
  fp.name as floor_plan,
  fp.image_id,
  CASE WHEN fp.image_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Image' ELSE 'MISSING' END as status
FROM floor_plans fp
JOIN communities c ON fp.community_id = c.id
WHERE c.active = true
ORDER BY c.name, fp.sort_order;
```

## Additional Checks Performed

### 1. Image Reference Integrity ✅
- All floor plans with image_id have valid references
- No broken references found
- Database integrity is good

### 2. Legacy imageUrl Field ✅
- No floor plans using the deprecated imageUrl field
- All communities have migrated to the new image_id system (or have no images)

### 3. Additional Images
- Some floor plans have multiple images via the floor_plan_images junction table
- Examples:
  - "Memory Care - One Bedroom" at Gardens on Quail: 3 additional images
  - "Assisted Living - Private Suite" at Gardens on Quail: 2 additional images
  - Multiple Columbine plans have 2 additional images each
