    "bio": "My name is Maria and I work at Golden Pond. I was born in Zacatecas, Mexico and raised in Denver, Colorado. My family moved here when I was 5yrs old. I have 2 sons. Growing up I was very close to my grandparents. I had great joy helping them in everything I could. In 2021 my last grandparent passed. I miss them dearly and working at a retirement community has helped me a lot. It brought me great joy, but also grief. I think that the hardest part of my job is meeting so many amazing people and not knowing if tomorrow I will get to see their faces once more. I've been a nanny, a server, a secretary for a construction company, a cashier, a hostess, a loan officers assistant and now a Life Enrichment Director which I absolutely love! I love making residents smile. I love helping them in every way I can. I've held Spanish classes which they enjoy very much. The connections and conversations I have with residents are always unique and fulfilling to say the least. It feels like taking care of my grandparents only this time I get paid for it. Every day is something new and exciting. I never thought I'd look forward to a job, which by the way does not feel like one to me. Outside of work I enjoy hiking, riding horses, making floral arrangements, spending time with my family, walks by the creek and skiing! I tried snowboarding but failed so stuck to skiing. I love nature. I love to cook more than eating out.",
