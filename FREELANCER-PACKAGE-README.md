## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare the Freelancer Package

Send the freelancer these files:
- All 9 CSV templates
- `COMMUNITY-DATA-UPLOAD-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

The Golden Pond row in each CSV is filled out as an example they can follow.

### Step 2: Freelancer Work

The freelancer will:
1. Research each community (Gardens at Columbine, Gardens on Quail, Stonebridge Senior)
2. Write compelling copy (descriptions, FAQs, testimonials)
3. Gather/upload images to a shared hosting service
4. Fill in all the spreadsheets with complete data
5. Return the completed CSV files to you

### Step 3: Review the Data

When you receive the completed files:
1. Open each CSV and verify completeness
2. Check that image URLs are valid
3. Ensure descriptions are unique and compelling
4. Verify contact information is accurate

### Step 4: Import to Database

Once you've reviewed and approved the data:

```bash
# Install the csv-parse dependency if not already installed
npm install

# Run the import script
npm run import:community-data
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Import all community data
- ‚úÖ Upload/process images
- ‚úÖ Create relationships (care types, amenities)
- ‚úÖ Handle duplicates gracefully
- ‚úÖ Show progress as it imports

## üìä Data Coverage

Each community will have:
- ‚úÖ Complete profile (name, address, contact, descriptions)
- ‚úÖ 5-10 team member profiles
- ‚úÖ 10-15 FAQ entries
- ‚úÖ 5-10 photo galleries (with 3-10 images each)
- ‚úÖ 3-4 highlight cards
- ‚úÖ 3-5 feature sections
- ‚úÖ 5-10 testimonials
- ‚úÖ 3-8 floor plans
- ‚úÖ 2-5 upcoming events

**Total per community:** 30-50+ images, 50+ pieces of content

## üé® Image Requirements Reminder

Make sure the freelancer knows:
- Minimum 1200px wide for large images
- Professional quality (no phone snapshots)
- All images need descriptive alt text
- Photos should be of the actual communities, not stock photos
- Upload to a reliable hosting service (or provide access to your storage)

## üí∞ Freelancer Budget Guidance

Estimated time for a freelancer:
- Research: 2-3 hours per community
- Writing: 3-4 hours per community (descriptions, FAQs, testimonials)
- Image sourcing/editing: 2-3 hours per community
- Data entry: 2-3 hours per community
- **Total per community: 10-12 hours**
- **Total for all 4 communities: 40-48 hours**

At $25-50/hour, budget: **$1,000 - $2,400** depending on freelancer rate and experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Importing

1. **Backup your database** - The import script will overwrite existing data
2. **Test on staging first** - Don't run directly on production
3. **Install dependencies** - Run `npm install` to get csv-parse
4. **Image hosting** - Decide where images will be hosted and communicate this to the freelancer

### Image Upload Function

The import script includes a placeholder for image uploading. You may need to customize the `uploadImageFromUrl()` function in `scripts/import-community-data.ts` based on your image storage solution (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.).

Currently it creates database records with the URLs provided, but you may want to:
- Download images and re-upload to your storage
- Process/optimize images (resize, compress)
- Generate multiple sizes for responsive images

### Care Types & Amenities

The script will automatically create care types and amenities that don't exist. Make sure the freelancer uses consistent naming:
- "Independent Living" (not "Independent" or "IL")
- "Assisted Living" (not "Assisted" or "AL")
- "Memory Care" (not "Memory" or "MC")

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import fails with "Community not found"
- Make sure `community-data-template.csv` is imported first
- Check that community slugs match exactly across all files

### Images not displaying
- Verify image URLs are publicly accessible
- Check that the `uploadImageFromUrl()` function is working
- Ensure image file formats are supported (JPG, PNG, WebP)

### Duplicate entries
- The script uses `onConflictDoUpdate` to handle duplicates
- Re-running the import will update existing records
- Delete old data first if you want a clean import

### Missing dependencies
```bash
npm install csv-parse
```

## üìù Customization

You can modify the CSV templates to:
- Add more image columns to galleries
- Add custom fields specific to your communities
- Remove fields you don't need
- Change field names (but update import script accordingly)
