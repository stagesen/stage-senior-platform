  - "quail"

2. Loading care type research from `landing-page-research.json`
3. Determining care type from URL pattern
4. Customizing messaging based on page focus (near me, best, luxury, etc.)
5. Incorporating care-type specific services and benefits
6. Using dynamic tokens for city and care type replacement
