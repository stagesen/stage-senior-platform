    "overview": "Gardens on Quail is a safe, secure assisted living and memory care community in Arvada, Colorado. Our campus offers compassionate care, engaging amenities and homelike comforts with 24/7 assistance and a vibrant social calendar.",
    "description": "**Our Community**\n\nGardens on Quail features 56 assisted living apartments and a dedicated memory care neighborhood with 27 private suites.  Our philosophy centers on empowering residents and focusing on abilities rather than limitations.  A secure courtyard with heated walkways, train set and water feature invites outdoor enjoyment year‑round.  Spacious common areas include lounges with fireplaces, a fully stocked library, workout facilities, high‑end salon, chapel and community dining rooms with à‑la‑carte menus and daily specials.  Raised garden beds, a greenhouse, putting green and basketball court encourage fresh air and exercise.\n\n**Dining**\n\nOur chef‑driven program uses fresh seasonal ingredients—including vegetables and herbs from our on‑site gardens—to create delicious restaurant‑style meals.  Residents enjoy scratch‑made soups, weekly chef specials, vegetarian and diabetic options, wine nights and happy hours.  Private dining rooms, including a 1950s themed space, are available for special occasions and custom menus.\n\n**Activities & Programs**\n\nA full calendar of events keeps residents engaged: Happy Hour Fridays, Family Brunches, holiday celebrations, spa days and themed parties.  Weekly clubs include women's tea, men's club, Tasty Tuesdays, book and Bible studies, art therapy, outdoor gardening, pet interaction, Wii gaming, live music and memory‑care activities like balloon volleyball and hallway bowling.  Special outings take residents to the aquarium, museum, shopping, Rockies games, car shows, mountain trips and intergenerational programs with local schools.\n\n**Memory Care Philosophy**\n\nOur dementia‑capable care model integrates person‑centered approaches, Montessori methods, validation therapy and the Eden Alternative.  We emphasise meaningful activities, independence and social connection to support cognitive health.  Neighborhoods are named after Colorado towns and feature local artwork and Friday happy hours with entertainment.  Personalized care begins with a \"My Story\" assessment to understand each resident's history and preferences.",
