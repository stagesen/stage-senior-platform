## 🎓 Methodology Used

### Parallel Agent Workflow
Instead of manual sequential work, we used **3 concurrent agents** to:

1. **Agent 1:** Import Gardens on Quail gallery (44 images)
2. **Agent 2:** Create Gardens on Quail features/highlights
3. **Agent 3:** Audit pricing across all 4 communities

Then launched **2 more agents** for:
4. **Agent 4:** Add hero images for all communities
5. **Agent 5:** Verify floor plan images

Finally:
6. **Agent 6:** Comprehensive QA audit

**Result:** Work that would take 8-12 hours manually was completed in ~2 hours using parallel agents.
